BACKGROUND Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to prevent organ transplant rejection in combination with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. It has a different toxicity profile than tacrolimus and cyclosporine.  Gastrointestinal tract disturbances are the most common adverse effects. The use of MMF in pregnant women, however, holds great risk of miscarriage and fetal development defects such as external ear malformation, ocular anomalies, cleft lip and palate, and abnormality of distal limbs, heart, esophagus, and kidneys. Based on post-marketing studies, its pregnancy category was reclassified as category D by the US FDA in 2007. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old woman received a deceased-donor liver transplant for end-stage liver disease secondary to autoimmune hepatitis. She had 3 miscarriages while on MMF. In her fourth pregnancy she was exposed to MMF in the first trimester, which was stopped by week 20 of the pregnancy. Obstetric ultrasound suggested a cephalic presentation fetus with abdominal circumference. Her pregnancy resulted in an infant with tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, and a bilateral ear canal atresia (microtia) with normal sensorineural conduction. There were no other congenital abnormalities. Thoracoscopic ligation of fistula and thoracotomy with esophageal repair were performed and a bone-anchored hearing aid for conductive hearing loss was implanted. Here, we report a case of congenital esophageal atresia and microtia secondary to mycophenolate mofetil. CONCLUSIONS MMF should be avoided during pregnancy. Transplanted female patients of reproductive age should receive appropriate counseling.
30367758	2018/12/20	Meglumine Antimoniate	Eosinophilia	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	1	0	Meglumine antimoniate-induced DRESS: original case with a positive skin test.	We report a case of a 64-year-old woman treated with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime(R)). On day 20, she developed fever, a pruriginous skin rash and myalgia. The blood tests showed eosinophilia and hepatic cytolysis. The clinico-biological picture improved gradually and the symptoms disappeared 4 weeks after the drug withdrawal. Six weeks later, intradermal tests to Glucantime(R) were performed and were positive at 48 hour-reading. This clinical picture suggests DRESS induced by meglumine antimoniate. To the best of our knowledge, only one case of meglumine antimoniate-induced DRESS has been reported in the literature and we are the first to report a case confirmed by skin tests.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy factors have been implicated in offspring oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) symptoms. Literature still holds notable limitations, such as studying only a restricted set of pregnancy factors, use of screening questionnaires which assess broadly defined outcome measures, and lack of control for disruptive behavior comorbidity and genetic confounds. We aimed to address these gaps by prospectively studying a broad range of pregnancy factors in relation to both offspring ODD and CD symptomatology in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parent and Children. METHODS: Outcomes were ODD and CD symptom scores at age 7;9 years using the Development and Well-Being Assessment interview. We analyzed maternal (N  approximately  6300) and teacher ratings (N  approximately  4400) of ODD and CD scores separately using negative binomial regression in multivariable models. Control variables included comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, ODD or CD symptoms as appropriate, and genetic risk scores based on an independent CD genome-wide association study. RESULTS: Higher ODD symptom scores were linked to paracetamol use (IRR = 1.24 [98.3% confidence interval 1.05-1.47], P = 0.002, teacher ratings) and life events stress (IRR = 1.22 [1.07-1.39], P = 0.002, maternal ratings) during pregnancy. Higher CD symptom scores were linked to maternal smoking (IRR = 1.33 [1.18-1.51], P < 0.001, maternal ratings), life events stress (IRR = 1.24 [1.11-1.38], P < 0.001, maternal ratings) and depressive symptoms (IRR = 1.14 [1.01-1.30], P = 0.006, maternal ratings) during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Common and potentially preventable pregnancy risk factors were independently related to both offspring ODD and CD symptomatology in children from the general population. Future studies should further address genetic confounds and confounding by environmental factors later in life.

Out of the various risk factors for postpartum depression, use of pharmacotherapy during pregnancy is the most poorly understood. The present study aimed to establish risk of postpartum depression and suicidal ideations with antenatal use of alpha methyldopa. Out of the 100 postpartum women assessed, 77.78% of the women who were prescribed alpha methyldopa had significant postpartum depression. There was statistically significant risk of postpartum depression associated with alpha methyldopa (p = 0.026, OR = 6.45). There was no increased suicidal risk with use of alpha methyldopa in these women (p = 1.00).

BACKGROUND: Despite many advances in surgery and technology, colonic anastomosis remains a challenge after colonic resection. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety of using diclofenac sodium and paracetamol for analgesia in colonic anastomosis on rats. METHODS: Wistar-Hannover rats were randomly allocated to four groups: Group 1, sham-operated group; Group 2, control group; Group 3, diclofenac sodium group; Group 4, paracetamol group. After laparotomy, the left colon was transected and a single-layer anastomosis was made with 5/0 vicryl in Groups 2, 3, and 4. Only laparotomy was performed in Group 1. After anastomosis, we administered saline to Group 2, diclofenac sodium to Group 3, and paracetamol to Group 4 for 7 days. Then, all animals were decapitated. The anastomotic region was resected, and bursting pressure was measured. Then, the specimen was sent to the laboratory for histological examination and hydroxyproline analysis. RESULTS: Bursting pressure and hydroxyproline level were significantly higher in the paracetamol group (p<0.05). When we looked at the fibrosis levels of these groups, it was also higher in paracetamol group. CONCLUSION: Bursting pressure, hydroxyproline levels, and fibrosis levels indicate that the perioperative use of paracetamol for analgesia when undergoing colonic anastomosis is safer than diclofenac sodium.

BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonists (DAs) are efficacious for the treatment of motor and nonmotor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The treatment of PD with DAs is often complicated by adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic origins. The DA piribedil is widely used in Asian, European, and Latin American countries; therefore, its ADRs are pertinent to clinicians. Here we present a rare case of hypotension and bradycardia that is significantly related to the dosage of piribedil. CASE PRESENTATION: A middle-aged male, diagnosed with PD, received dopamine replacement with piribedil. When taking 50 mg piribedil daily dose, the patient didn't feel any discomfort. Two hours after taking 100 mg piribedil he presented with serious concomitant hypotension and bradycardia with a blood pressure (BP) reading of 85/48 mmHg and a heart rate (HR) of 45 beats/min when sitting. After taking 75 mg piribedil, the patient showed the same symptoms with BP reading at 70/45 mmHg and HR of 47 beats/min in the same position. Upon replacing treatment with pramipexole 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, and 0.375 mg three times a day, no further cardiovascular effects persisted. CONCLUSIONS: No studies have previously reported the simultaneous observation of position-unrelated hypotension and bradycardia after taking small doses of piribedil. More studies are needed to explore the effects of DAs on BP and HR, especially piribedil. Piribedil is efficacious for the treatment of PD, but it is important to weigh the potential risk of hypotension and bradycardia against the clinical benefits of this drug.

PURPOSE: To our knowledge it is unknown whether the benefits of medical management of urolithiasis outweigh the potential side effects of the medications used, including potassium citrate and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between potassium citrate or thiazides and overall stone related health related quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained on stone forming enrollees in the North American Stone Quality of Life Consortium. We used the WISQOL (Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life) questionnaire to compare health related quality of life between patients treated and not treated with potassium citrate or thiazide type diuretics. Additionally, the likelihood of gastrointestinal complaints was compared between those prescribed and not prescribed potassium citrate. The likelihood of fatigue and sexual complaints was also compared in those prescribed and not prescribed thiazides. RESULTS: Of the 1,511 subjects, including 787 males and 724 females, 279 were on potassium citrate and 238 were on thiazides at study enrollment. Patients prescribed potassium citrate had higher health related quality of life in each domain vs those not prescribed potassium citrate (p <0.001). Patients prescribed thiazides had higher health related quality of life in each domain compared to those not prescribed thiazide (all p <0.01). Those prescribed potassium citrate were less likely than those not prescribed potassium citrate to report nausea, stomach upset or cramps (OR 0.57, p <0.001). Patients prescribed thiazides were less likely than those not prescribed thiazides to report fatigue (OR 0.63, p = 0.004) or reduced sexual interest and/or activity (OR 0.64, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Among stone formers the use of potassium citrate and thiazides was associated with better health related quality of life across all WISQOL domains without an increased likelihood of gastrointestinal complaints and fatigue or sexual complaints, respectively. These findings may be useful when counseling patients regarding the initiation of potassium citrate or thiazides for medical management of nephrolithiasis.

29087803	2018/10/6	Everolimus	Ovarian Cysts	Controlled Clinical Trial_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	High Incidence of Ovarian Cysts in Women Receiving mTOR Inhibitors After Renal Transplantation.	OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cysts are a common finding in reproductive-aged females. Most of them are functional cysts that typically resolve spontaneously and require no treatment. However, ovarian cysts may also be adverse events associated with inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Both approved mTOR inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus are widely used as immunosuppressive agents after organ transplantation. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of mTOR inhibitors vs. non-mTOR inhibitor immunosuppression on the incidence, size and complication rate of ovarian cysts in renal transplant recipients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 571 consecutive female kidney transplant patients in our centre between 2000 and 2008. The follow-up period was extended through December 31st, 2012. RESULTS: 102 (17.8%) patients received mTOR inhibitors for at least one month after transplantation. We identified 44 women (7.7%) with new ovarian cysts. Ovarian cysts were significantly more frequent among patients receiving mTOR inhibitors (20.5%) than in the control group (4.9%; p < 0.001). Also the hospitalization rate was higher (p = 0.05) in the mTOR group and ten patients (47.6%) requiring surgery. CONCLUSION: Future prospective studies are required to determine the underlying cause of ovarian toxicity and treatment strategies have to be developed in order to avoid severe complications.
30326844	2018/12/12	Sofosbuvir	Ventricular Dysfunction, Left	Journal Article	0	1	0	0	0	Evaluation of cardiac function by global longitudinal strain before and after treatment with sofosbuvir-based regimens in HCV infected patients.	BACKGROUND: Possible cardiotoxicity of sofosbuvir in humans has not been demonstrated yet. Also, since HCV can exert deleterious effects on hearth function, it is of interest to know whether HCV eradication provides any benefits using global longitudinal strain (GLS), a measure of left ventricular function more reliable than ejection fraction (EF). METHODS: Patients eligible for treatment with the combination therapy for HCV were invited to perform a transthoracic cardiac ultrasound at four different time points: before starting treatment, after one month, at the end of treatment and, after six month. Left ventricular function was measured with both EF and GLS. RESULTS: From March 2015 to December 2016, 82 patients were enrolled. Fifty-six percent patients were males. Mean age was 66.12 (SD: 9.25) years. About 20% patients did not present any cardiovascular risk factors or comorbidities. A worsening trend of GLS was observed. Variations were not found to be statistically significant when EF was studied along the follow-up. However, when GLS was studied, its variations were found to be statistically significant indicating a worsening effect, albeit with different trends in patients who underwent treatment for three months compared to six months. Worsening of GLS was found to be statistically significant even after adjusting for body mass index and liver fibrosis, independently from treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed unexpected worsening of left ventricular function when measured through GLS after HCV treatment response induced by DAAs including sofosbuvir. Although this result is not proven to be clinically significant, the safety profile of sofosbuvir-based regimens needs to be studied further.

BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab administration is known to cause secondary autoimmune disease but has not been associated with the development of neurologic autoimmune conditions. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is caused by autoantibodies directed against calcium channels on the neuromuscular junction. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a patient with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) treated with alemtuzumab who develop generalized weakness initially attributed to progression of MS but eventually determined to be due to LEMS. CONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab treatment can result in the development of neurologic autoimmune conditions that could mimic MS progression.
30543944	2019/3/21	Sulfur Dioxide	Dry Eye Syndromes	Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	Impacts of air pollution on dry eye disease among residents in Hangzhou, China: A case-crossover study.	The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential associations between air pollution and dry eye disease (DED). Data of outdoor air pollutants and meteorology as well as outpatient visits for DED were collected. A time-stratified case-crossover approach was used to analyze the associations between ambient air pollutants and outpatient visits for DED. Among the 5062 DED patients studied, 65.45% were female and 34.55% were male. In the single-pollutant model, significant associations were observed between an increase of 10 mug/m(3) in the concentrations of fine-particulate matter with a median aerometric diameter of less than 10 mum (PM(10)), fine-particulate matter with a median aerometric diameter of less than 2.5 mum (PM(2.5)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and carbon monoxide (CO) and outpatient visits for DED. These results were consistent with those of the multipollutant model. The strongest associations between air pollutants and patient visits were observed during the cold season and in patients aged 21-40. The significant association between air pollutants (PM(10), PM(2.5), SO(2), NO(2), and CO) and DED outpatient visits indicates the importance of increased environmental protection.

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that does not cross an intact blood-brain barrier. In the EMILIA trial of T-DM1 vs capecitabine/lapatinib for HER2 positive advanced breast cancer, all patients had baseline brain imaging, and 9/450 (2%) of patients with negative baseline imaging developed new brain disease during T-DM1. We assessed the frequency of brain progression in clinical practice, without routine baseline imaging. We undertook a retrospective study of all patients treated with T-DM1 at the Royal Marsden Hospital from 2011 to 2016. Data collected included baseline characteristics, previous treatment for advanced breast cancer, sites of metastatic disease, duration of T-DM1, sites of progression, and treatment of CNS progression. Fifty-five patients were identified who had received a median of two prior lines of treatment (range 0-5). All were HER2 positive; 45 patients had IHC 3+ tumors and 10 were ISH positive. Patients received a median of 12 cycles of T-DM1 (range 1-34), and six remain on treatment at the time of analysis. Before commencing T-DM1, 16/55 (29%) had known brain metastases (treated with whole brain [9] stereotactic radiotherapy [6] or both [1]). Brain was the first site of progression in 56% (9/16) patients, with a median time to brain progression of 9.9 months (95% CI 3.9-12.2). In patients without known baseline brain metastases, 17.9% (7/39) developed new symptomatic brain disease during T-DM1, after a median of 7.5 months (95%CI 3.8-9.6). Brain progression was isolated, with control of extra-cranial disease in 4/7 patients. Only one patient was suitable for stereotactic radiotherapy. Median time to extra-cranial progression in all patients was 11.5 months (95% CI 9.1-17.7), and median OS in all patients was 17.8 months (95% CI 14.2-22). In patients not screened for brain metastases at baseline, the brain was the first site of progression in a significant proportion. Baseline brain imaging may have a role in standard practice for patients commencing T-DM1 therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To assess fetal risk after pregnancy exposure to natalizumab in women with multiple sclerosis (MS), with a specific focus on spontaneous abortion (SA) and congenital anomalies (CA). METHODS: Data of all pregnancies occurring between 2009 and 2015 in patients with MS treated with natalizumab and referring to 19 participating sites were collected and compared with those of pregnancies in untreated patients and patients treated with injectable immunomodulatory agents. Rates of SA and CA were also compared with those reported in the Italian population. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were performed. RESULTS: A total of 92 pregnancies were tracked in 83 women. In the multivariable analysis, natalizumab exposure was associated with SA (odds ratio [OR] 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-8.5, p < 0.001). However, the rate of SA (17.4%) was within the estimates for the general population, as well as the rate of major CA (3.7%). Moreover, exposure to natalizumab and interferon-beta (IFN-beta) was associated with lower length and weight of the babies (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that natalizumab exposure to up 12 weeks of gestation is associated with an increased risk of SA, although within the limits expected in the general population, whereas the risk of CA needs further investigation. Taking into account the high risk of disease reactivation after natalizumab suspension, pregnancy could be planned continuing natalizumab while strictly monitoring conception. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that in women with MS, natalizumab exposure increases the risk of spontaneous abortion as compared to IFN-beta-exposed or untreated patients (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.9-8.5).

PURPOSE: To describe the patient's allergic response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs after receiving intravitreal bevacizumab for choroidal neovascularization. METHODS: Clinical case report. RESULTS: Formal allergy evaluation revealed hypersensitivity to bevacizumab and ranibizumab, but not to pegaptanib or aflibercept. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab and ranibizumab are derivatives of murine monoclonal antibodies, whereas pegaptanib is an aptamer and aflibercept is a fusion protein of human origin. These chemical origins may allow patients to receive pegaptanib or aflibercept despite having allergy to bevacizumab or ranibizumab.
30275683	2018/12/26	Hydroxyethyl Starch Derivatives	Ureteral Obstruction	Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	Effects of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 on the kidney tissue of rats with ureteral obstruction.	OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted since the effects of colloid solutions on the renal system remain controversial and need to be adequately studied in animals. We aimed to evaluate the effects of hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) on the kidney tissue of rats with late renal failure due to ureteral obstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were divided into four groups: Group C, control; Group HES, hydroxyethyl starch solution (HES) 130/0.4 (Voluven((R))); Group UUO, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO); and Group UUO-HES, UUO-HES 130/0.4 (Voluven((R))). In the groups with ureteral obstruction, the distal part of the right ureter was accessed and sutured through a lower abdominal incision under ketamine anesthesia. Any signs of late-stage renal failure were evaluated after three weeks. Rats in the HES group and the renal failure-HES group were administered with HES 130/0.4 as a single intravenous dose of 20 mL/kg. After a follow-up of 24 hours, intra-abdominal blood sample was collected, and the rats were sacrificed. Biochemical and histopathological parameters were then evaluated. RESULTS: Ureteral obstruction significantly increased urea and creatinine levels. In addition, when the UUO-HES and HES groups were compared, the administration of HES increased urea and creatinine levels in the UUO-HES group. Nitric oxide enzyme activity and malondialdehyde levels have significantly increased in the UUO groups. In addition, HES significantly increased nitric oxide activity and malondialdehyde levels in the UUO-HES group, in comparison with the HES group. The activity of caspases 3 and 8 was significantly increased in the UUO groups. In addition, HES significantly increased the activity of caspases 3 and 8 in the UUO-HES group, in comparison with the HES group. Light microscopy revealed significant changes in the UUO groups, especially in the obstructed kidneys. CONCLUSION: If indicated, HES should be used with caution in cases of UUO, but not in the cases of bilateral ureteral obstruction. Other aspects of these findings, including the clinical significance and practical applications, merit further experimental and clinical investigation.

30152807	2019/6/14	Cisplatin	Edema, Cardiac	Journal Article	0	1	0	0	0	The effect of rutin on cisplatin-induced oxidative cardiac damage in rats.	OBJECTIVE: Cisplatin is an anticancer drug used for treating childhood solid tumors. Symptoms related to cisplatin-induced cardiovascular adverse effects may be mild or severe. Rutin (vitamin P1) has many properties, including as antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antiulcer, and tissue renewal properties. Therefore, we aimed to biochemically, histopathologically, and immunohistochemically demonstrate the effect of rutin on cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. METHODS: The rats included in our study were divided into four groups: Healthy group (HE), 5-mg/kg cisplatin group (CP), 50 mg/kg rutin+5-mg/kg cisplatin (CR-50), 100-mg/kg rutin+5-mg/kg cisplatin (CR-100) group. RESULTS: CP group administered cisplatin had significantly increased blood, serum, and cardiac tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1ss), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), troponin I, creatine kinase (CK), and CK-MB levels compared to the HE group, whereas there was a significant decrease in the total glutathione (tGSH) levels. Rutin was observed to prevent the increase in MDA, IL-1ss, TNF-alpha, troponin I, CK, and CK-MB levels as well as prevent the decrease in tGSH levels more significantly when administered at a 100-mg/kg dose than at a 50-mg/kg dose. Histopathologically, cardiac necrosis, dilated/congested blood vessels, hemorrhage, polymorphonuclear leukocyte, edema, and cells with pyknotic nuclei were observed in the CP group. Rutin was shown to prevent cisplatin-induced cardiac damage more effectively when used at a100-mg/kg dose than at a 50-mg/kg dose. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that rutin is useful for preventing cisplatin-related cardiovascular damage.

29155440	2018/12/12	Lenalidomide	Hypoglycemia	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	1	1	1	Severe Hypoglycemia Caused by Lenalidomide.	Lenalidomide is commonly used for multiple myeloma as either induction or maintenance therapy. The agent is associated with a host of adverse effects, but hypoglycemia has only been reported in one phase I trial in patients with solid tumors. We describe a 74-year-old woman who experienced grade 3 hypoglycemia (blood glucose level 35 mg/dl) likely related to lenalidomide. Her medical history was significant for refractory myeloma and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lenalidomide was started as maintenance therapy following autologous bone marrow transplantation. Approximately 3 years later, she developed refractory hypoglycemia necessitating hospital admission despite stopping antihyperglycemic agents 4 weeks prior to admission. Lenalidomide was withheld during her admission and restarted 2 days prior to discharge. Work-up for causes of persistent hypoglycemia was negative, and her glucose levels improved over her 26-day hospitalization. She was readmitted approximately one month later for hypoglycemia, and lenalidomide was permanently discontinued. Again, work-up for causes of hypoglycemia was negative, and her glucose levels stabilized over her hospitalization. After discontinuation of lenalidomide, hypoglycemia did not recur, and within 1 year the patient required reinitiation of antihyperglycemic medications to control her glucose levels. Given the resolution of hypoglycemia with lenalidomide discontinuation and return of hyperglycemia after restarting the agent, it is likely that lenalidomide was the cause of the patient's hypoglycemia. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a definite relationship (score of 9) between the patient's development of grade 3 hypoglycemia and lenalidomide therapy. Although this adverse drug reaction had been previously reported with lenalidomide during phase I trials in patients with solid tumors, only grade 1 or 2 hypoglycemia was reported in three patients. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of grade 3 hypoglycemia caused by lenalidomide.

PURPOSE: To derive novel insights into the pathophysiology of vancomycin-related hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculopathy (HORV) through a careful clinicopathologic correlation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and pathologic course of 2 consecutive patients who developed HORV. The clinical history, multimodal imaging, ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), and intraoperative and histologic findings are reported. RESULTS: Both patients presented with decreased vision and eye pain within 1 week following otherwise uncomplicated cataract extraction and were diagnosed with HORV after endophthalmitis was ruled out. Both patients presented with significant ocular discomfort that progressively worsened, and both experienced a dismal visual outcome despite early aggressive medical and surgical therapy. One patient requested enucleation for a blind and painful eye. Upon histologic examination of this eye, the iris and ciliary body appeared to be infarcted with separation of the iris and ciliary epithelia from their adjacent stromal components. These findings were corroborated by UBM of the second patient. Histologic examination of the posterior segment demonstrated severe hemorrhagic necrosis of the neurosensory retina and an occlusive nonarteritic vasculopathy of the retina and choroid. The choroid was thickened by prominent nongranulomatous chronic inflammation accompanied by a glomeruloid proliferation of small vessels. The inflammatory infiltrate was almost exclusively confined to the choroid and consisted of predominantly T cells. There was conspicuous absence of inflammatory cells in the retina and no histologic evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. CONCLUSIONS: HORV is a rare condition that can lead to profound vision loss. Significant ocular pain can be a presenting sign of HORV in cases with severe iris and ciliary body ischemia. Although it has been suggested that HORV is a form of leukocytoclastic retinal vasculitis, the histologic findings herein indicate that the pathophysiology is more complex. It is grounded in a necrotizing retinal vasculopathy in the absence of retinal vasculitis, chronic nongranulomatous choroiditis, and an unusual glomeruloid proliferation of endothelial cells in the choroid and elsewhere in the eye.

A 65-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced non-small, non-squamous lung cancer. He was treated with chemotherapy containing bevacizumab as well as cisplatin and pemetrexed. After 2 courses of treatment, computed tomography revealed that his abdominal aortic artery was almost occluded by a thrombus; however, he had no ischemic symptoms. Heparin infusion and warfarin reduced the size of the arterial thrombus and the patient was subsequently treated with chemotherapy without bevacizumab. No thrombotic events occurred during the subsequent treatment. We later noticed a small organized abdominal arterial clot and calcification on a computed tomography scan taken before bevacizumab treatment. Atherosclerotic changes should be evaluated before the administration of bevacizumab.

Axitinib has emerged as a promising antineoplastic agent for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Although the administration of axitinib was well-tolerated in clinical trials, the real-world safety and tolerability remain unverified. We herein report a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who suddenly developed life-threatening hyperkalemia following the initiation of axitinib treatment. Although hyperkalemia has been reported with an incidence of <10%, acute severe hyperkalemia may be a considerably critical adverse event of axitinib therapy, especially in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia. An abundance of caution for unusual and unpredictable toxicities is warranted when using axitinib.

Few trials have examined rates of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) with intravenous iron formulations used to treat iron deficiency anemia (IDA). This randomized, multicenter, double-blind clinical trial compared the safety, and efficacy of ferumoxytol versus ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), focusing on rates of HSRs and hypotension as the primary end point. Patients with IDA of any etiology in whom oral iron was unsatisfactory or intolerable received ferumoxytol (n = 997) or FCM (n = 1000) intravenously over >/=15 minutes on days 1 and 8 or 9 for total respective doses of 1.02 g and 1.50 g. Composite incidences of moderate-to-severe HSRs, including anaphylaxis, or moderate-to-severe hypotension from baseline to week 5 (primary safety end point) were 0.6% and 0.7% in the ferumoxytol and FCM groups, respectively, with ferumoxytol noninferior to FCM. No anaphylaxis was reported in either group. The secondary safety end point of incidences of moderate-to-severe HSRs, including anaphylaxis, serious cardiovascular events, and death from baseline to week 5 were 1.3% and 2.0% in the ferumoxytol and FCM groups, respectively (noninferiority test P < .0001). Least-squares mean changes in hemoglobin at week 5 were 1.4 g/dL and 1.6 g/dL in the ferumoxytol and FCM groups, respectively (noninferiority test P < .0001). Incidence of hypophosphatemia was 0.4% for ferumoxytol and 38.7% for FCM.

Hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV) or leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a rare small-vessel vasculitis that may occur as a manifestation of the body's extreme allergic reaction to a drug, infection, or other foreign substance. Characterized by the presence of inflammatory neutrophils in vessel walls, HV results in inflammation and damage to blood vessels, primarily in the skin. Histologically, when neutrophils undergo leukocytoclasia and release nuclear debris into the vasculature, vascular damage manifests as palpable purpura. The incidence of HV is unknown and its relationship and interaction with certain vaccinations is rare and poorly understood. Affected patients with HV generally have a good prognosis; however, fatality may occur if organs such as the central nervous system, heart, lungs, or kidneys are involved. We report a unique case of a 60-year-old man who presented with a serious case of HV after receiving the herpes zoster vaccine. A thorough literature review yielded only one similar case of vascular reaction to the varicella vaccine that was reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 1997; however, no other reported cases with regard to the herpes zoster vaccine have been found. Our case presents a rare glimpse into HV that may result from varicella vaccine administration.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bevacizumab intravitreal injection, a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, is used to treat retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, concerns have been raised regarding its systemic absorption and effect on developing tissues including brain. This study compared neurodevelopment at 18 months' corrected age in preterm infants of <29 weeks' gestation treated with bevacizumab versus laser ablation. METHODS: Data from the Canadian Neonatal Network and the Canadian Neonatal Follow-Up Network databases were retrospectively reviewed. Infants born at <29 weeks' in 2010-2011 with treated ROP were studied. Neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months was assessed by using neurologic examination and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition. Regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 125 treated infants, 27 received bevacizumab and 98 laser. The bevacizumab group, compared with laser, obtained a median Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition motor composite score of 81 (interquartile range, 70-91) versus 88 (79-97), a language composite score of 79 (65-97) versus 89 (74-97), and a cognitive score of 90 (80-100) versus 90 (85-100). Difference was detected on the motor score only (P = .02). Odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities (Bayley scores <70, severe cerebral palsy, hearing aids, or bilateral blindness) was 3.1 times higher (95% confidence interval: 1.2-8.4) in infants treated with bevacizumab versus laser after adjusting for gestational age, gender, maternal education, Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology-II score, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, sepsis, and severe brain injury. CONCLUSIONS: Preterm infants treated with bevacizumab versus laser had higher odds of severe neurodevelopmental disabilities. Further investigation on the long-term safety of antivascular endothelial growth factor treatment of ROP is needed.

Fingolimod, taken orally once per day, is approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). It should be stopped at least two months before conception as it is not considered safe during pregnancy or when breast feeding. In vitro and animal studies have found a possibly increased risk of congenital abnormalities following exposure to Fingolimod. Here, we report a 34-year-old female, with a 10-year history of MS who had unexpected pregnancy with exposure to generic Fingolimod during the first 7 weeks. The infant was born with dextrocardia, but without any further structural cardiac or other abnormalities.

INTRODUCTION: Topical beta-blockers are a proven and safe medication used in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Local and systemic side effects are, however, well documented. Systemic side effects can include severe cardio-respiratory impairment, endocrine dysfunction, as well as headache and hyper-somnolence. Disorders involving fibrosis such as Peyronie's disease, Dupuytren's contracture, and retroperitoneal fibrosis are rarely described in the literature. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of a 55-year-old male patient undergoing treatment for ocular hypertension with topical timolol 0.25% to both eyes, who subsequently developed both Peyronie's disease and Dupuytren's contracture. To our knowledge, this is the first case of Dupuytren's contracture secondary to the use of topical timolol. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst uncommon, beta-blockers are known to be associated with such fibrotic conditions and have been reported with the use of topical timolol. This case serves to increase the current understanding of this association.
29661354	2018/12/14	Magnesium Oxide <partly correct?>	Acute Kidney Injury	Case Reports_and_Journal Article_and_Review	1	1	0	1	1	Fatal Hypermagnesemia Due to Laxative Use.	We report a case of fatal hypermagnesemia in a 53-year-old woman admitted for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and with a history of chronic constipation treated regularly with magnesium-containing laxatives. On admission, her magnesium level was 2.0mg/dL, which rose to a peak of 10.8mg/dL despite hydration and diuresis in the presence of a normal kidney function. Continuous renal replacement therapy was promptly initiated, which reduced her serum magnesium levels, but her condition continued to deteriorate precipitously progressing to shock leading to oligoanuric renal failure, and she died 2 days later. A review of the literature shows that though rare and often unsuspected, severe hypermagnesemia frequently results in death even in individuals with normal renal function despite renal replacement therapy. In patients with constipation, retention of magnesium-based laxative in the gut apparently serves as a reservoir for continuous magnesium absorption and contributes to mortality.

BACKGROUND: Hydrochlorothiazide use has been associated with markedly increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma. No previous studies have investigated the association between hydrochlorothiazide use and the risk for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and malignant adnexal skin tumors (MAST). OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between hydrochlorothiazide use and the risk for MCC and MAST. METHODS: Using Danish nationwide health registries, we identified all patients with incident MCC or MAST during 2004-2015 and matched the cases individually to cancer-free population controls by risk set sampling. Using conditional logistic regression, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) associated with cumulative use of hydrochlorothiazide. RESULTS: The adjusted ORs for MCC and MAST associated with high use (>/=50,000 mg) of hydrochlorothiazide was 2.3 (95% CI 1.1-4.8) and 3.6 (95% CI 1.9-7.0), respectively, which increased to 3.3 (95% CI 1.3-8.3) and 5.6 (95% CI 2.4-13.3), respectively, with highest use (>/=100,000 mg). We found no increased risk for these tumors in analyses of drugs with similar indications as hydrochlorothiazide, except there was a tendency toward an increased risk for MCC associated with the use of furosemide (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.9-4.0). LIMITATIONS: No data on sun exposure was available. CONCLUSION: Hydrochlorothiazide use is associated with an increased risk for MCC and MAST.

29178032	2019/8/14	Sodium Citrate	Polyuria	Journal Article_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	0	0	0	0	0	Lithium increases ammonium excretion leading to altered urinary acid-base buffer composition.	Previous reports identify a voltage dependent distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) secondary to lithium (Li(+)) salt administration. This was based on the inability of Li(+)-treated patients to increase the urine-blood (U-B) pCO(2) when challenged with NaHCO(3) and, the ability of sodium neutral phosphate or Na(2)SO(4) administration to restore U-B pCO(2) in experimental animal models. The underlying mechanisms for the Li(+)-induced dRTA are still unknown. To address this point, a 7 days time course of the urinary acid-base parameters was investigated in rats challenged with LiCl, LiCitrate, NaCl, or NaCitrate. LiCl induced the largest polyuria and a mild metabolic acidosis. Li(+)-treatment induced a biphasic response. In the first 2 days, proper urine volume and acidification occurred, while from the 3rd day of treatment, polyuria developed progressively. In this latter phase, the LiCl-treated group progressively excreted more NH(4)(+) and less pCO(2), suggesting that NH(3)/NH(4)(+) became the main urinary buffer. This physiological parameter was corroborated by the upregulation of NBCn1 (a marker of increased ammonium recycling) in the inner stripe of outer medulla of LiCl treated rats. Finally, by investigating NH(4)(+) excretion in ENaC-cKO mice, a model resistant to Li(+)-induced polyuria, a primary role of the CD was confirmed. By definition, dRTA is characterized by deficient urinary ammonium excretion. Our data question the presence of a voltage-dependent Li(+)-induced dRTA in rats treated with LiCl for 7 days and the data suggest that the alkaline urine pH induced by NH(3)/NH(4)(+) as the main buffer has lead to the interpretation dRTA in previous studies.

BACKGROUND: Psychiatric medications are widely prescribed in the USA. Many antipsychotics cause serum hyperprolactinemia as an adverse side effect; prolactin-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling both induces cell differentiation and suppresses apoptosis. It is controversial whether these antipsychotics increase breast cancer risk. METHODS: We investigated the impact of several antipsychotics on mammary tumorigenesis initiated by retrovirus-mediated delivery of either ErbB2 or HRas or by transgenic expression of Wnt-1. RESULTS: We found that the two hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics, risperidone and pimozide, prompted precancerous lesions to progress to cancer while aripiprazole, which did not cause hyperprolactinemia, did not. We observed that risperidone and pimozide (but not aripiprazole) caused precancerous cells to activate STAT5 and suppress apoptosis while exerting no impact on proliferation. Importantly, we demonstrated that these effects of antipsychotics on early lesions required the STAT5 gene function. Furthermore, we showed that only two-week treatment of mice with ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, blocked STAT5 activation, restored apoptosis, and prevented early lesion progression. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics instigate precancerous cells to progress to cancer via JAK/STAT5 to suppress the apoptosis anticancer barrier, and these cancer-promoting effects can be prevented by prophylactic anti-JAK/STAT5 treatment. This preclinical work exposes a potential breast cancer risk from hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics in certain patients and suggests a chemoprevention regime that is relatively easy to implement compared to the standard 5-year anti-estrogenic treatment in women who have or likely have already developed precancerous lesions while also requiring hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics.

A 30-year-old Japanese woman with Graves' disease, who was treated with PTU, reported with otitis media with sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and trigeminal neuralgia on the left side, as well as elevated serum levels of myeloperoxidase-ANCA. Prior treatment with antibiotics was ineffective even after tympanostomy. However, clinical remission was immediately achieved after initiating prednisolone together with PTU withdrawal.

BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is a widely used immunosuppressive agent that may provoke unexpected neurologic complications. The mechanism is unclear and variable intervals have been reported between CsA administration and onset of the related side effects. Here, we describe a case of delayed-onset CsA neurotoxicity presenting as opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS). CASE DETAILS: A 37-year-old woman with a two-week period of opsoclonus and upper extremity myoclonus was admitted to our hospital. The patient had been taking CsA for 17 years after receiving a kidney transplant. Further evaluation did not reveal any other abnormalities. Seven days after switching from CsA to tacrolimus, in the absence of additional immune-modulating therapy, her neurologic symptoms improved considerably. CONCLUSION: This is the case of delayed, long-term complications of CsA presenting as OMS. Symptoms resolved by substituting CsA with another immunomodulating drug. The etiology of the neurologic complications may involve paradoxically-enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity.

AIM: This study aimed to clarify the tolerability of a trifluridine/tipiracil combination tablet (TAS-102) in patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer over 75 years of age. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were divided into groups under the age of 75 years (n=62), and 75 years and over (n=17). The treatment period with TAS-102 tablet, reasons for discontinuation, adverse events (AEs), and overall survival (OS) were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The incidence of AEs (including neutropenia, anemia, nausea, malaise, and anorexia) was similar for both groups and the treatment enforcement periods for different regimens were not statistically significant between the groups (p=0.207). No major differences were observed in the reasons for discontinuation, such as AEs or progressive disease, between the two groups. CONCLUSION: TAS-102 therapy for advanced/recurrent colorectal cancer is considered to be highly tolerable in patients 75 years and older. These findings are important for AE monitoring and guidance for patients taking TAS-102.

BACKGROUND: Hypothermia is increasingly tested in several neurological conditions, such as neonatal encephalopathy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal cord injury, and neurological outcomes of cardiac arrest. Current studies aim to increase benefits of hypothermia with new add-on therapies including immunomodulatory agents. Hypothermia has been shown to affect the metabolism of commonly used drugs, including those acting on neuroimmune pathways. OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on the effect of hypothermia on interleukin-1 receptor antagonist pharmacodynamics in a model of neonatal encephalopathy. METHODS: The effect of hypothermia on (i) the tissue concentration of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, (ii) the interleukin-1 inflammatory cascade, and (iii) the neuroprotective potential of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist has been assessed on our rat model of neonatal encephalopathy resulting from inflammation induced by bacterial compound plus hypoxia-ischemia. RESULTS: Hypothermia reduced the surface of core and penumbra lesions, as well as alleviated the brain weight loss induced by LPS+HI exposure. Hypothermia compared to normothermia significantly increased (range 50-65%) the concentration of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist within the central nervous system. Despite this increase of intracerebral interleukin-1 receptor antagonist concentration, the intracerebral interleukin-1-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha cascade was upregulated. In hypothermic condition, the known neuroprotective effect of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist was neutralized (50 mg/kg/12 h for 72 h) or even reversed (200 mg/kg/12 h for 72 h) as compared to normothermic condition. CONCLUSION: Hypothermia interferes with the pharmacodynamic parameters of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, through a bioaccumulation of the drug within the central nervous system and a paradoxical upregulation of the interleukin-1 pathway. These effects seem to be at the origin of the loss of efficiency or even toxicity of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist when combined with hypothermia. Such bioaccumulation could happen similarly with the use of other drugs combined to hypothermia in a clinical context.

We discuss a unique case of sudden sensorineural hearing loss after Cialis (tadalafil) use, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, and the implication of ipsilateral cochlear hydrops seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We report a case of a 53-year-old male with unilateral low-frequency sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) after ingestion of tadalafil. The SSNHL occurred 1 day after ingestion and was associated with aural fullness and tinnitus. There were no symptoms of vertigo. He received oral prednisone immediately after the onset of hearing loss without improvement. Delayed intravenous contrast-enhanced three-dimensional Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI revealed ipsilateral dilation of the cochlear duct without any hydronic change in the vestibular system. Acetazolamide therapy was initiated, and his symptoms improved. A posttreatment audiogram revealed an increase in threshold of 15 dB. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of cochlear hydrops visualized on imaging after a PDE5 inhibitor induced SSNHL. Tadalafil and other PDE5 inhibitors have a known association with SSNHL. Despite several proposed mechanisms, there is inconclusive evidence of a causal relationship. Our presented case suggests that cochlear hydrops may be one possible mechanism of PDE5 inhibitor-associated SSNHL. MRI should be considered in the evaluation of such patients who do not respond to oral steroids as initial treatment. Laryngoscope, 2615-2618, 2018.

Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Its use is prohibited during pregnancy. However, natalizumab exposures throughout the gestation period or during the third trimester, because of intense disease activity, are possible and begin to be reported. There are enough reassuring arguments against a teratogenicity, through pregnancy registries; but deleterious effects in the monitoring of newborn, are not well known. A disorder of hematopoiesis is possible with anemia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia, as discussed by the author through an observation. These hematological disorders seem to be asymptomatic; they resolve spontaneously and require a simple biological and clinical monitoring of the newborn.
28743904	2019/2/28	Acrylamide	Cognitive Dysfunction	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Dietary acrylamide exposure was associated with mild cognition decline among non-smoking Chinese elderly men.	The aim of the study is to explore the longitudinal association of dietary acrylamide exposure with cognitive performance in Chinese elderly. The analysis was conducted among 2534 non-smoking elderly men and women based on a prospective study, Mr. and Ms. OS Hong Kong. Dietary acrylamide intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaires with data on local food contamination, derived from the first Hong Kong Total Diet Study. Global cognitive function was assessed by Cantonese version of Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) at the baseline and the 4(th) year of follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the associations of dietary acrylamide with MMSE score changes or risk of poor cognition. The results indicated that among men with MMSE >/= 18, each one SD increase of acrylamide decreased MMSE score by 7.698% (95%CI: -14.943%, -0.452%; p = 0.037). Logistic regression revealed an increased risk of poor cognition (MMSE </= 26) in men with HR of 3.356 (1.064~10.591, p = 0.039). The association became non-significance after further adjustment for telomere length. No significant association was observed in women. Dietary acrylamide exposure was associated with a mild cognitive decline or increased risk of poor cognition over a 4-year period in non-smoking Chinese elderly men.

PURPOSE: We evaluated the relative prevalence of secondary polycythemia in hypogonadal men treated with clomiphene citrate or testosterone replacement therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, multi-institutional study, we included 188 men who received clomiphene citrate and 175 who received testosterone replacement therapy with symptomatic hypogonadism. The overall prevalence and ORs of secondary polycythemia for clomiphene citrate treatment vs testosterone replacement were primarily measured, as were baseline characteristics. Subset analysis included polycythemia rates for different types of testosterone replacement therapy. RESULTS: Overall, men on testosterone replacement therapy were older than clomiphene citrate treated men (age 51.5 vs 38 years). Men on testosterone replacement had longer treatment duration than clomiphene citrate treated men (19.6 vs 9.2 months). For testosterone replacement therapy and clomiphene citrate the mean change in hematocrit was 3.0% and 0.6%, and the mean change in serum testosterone was 333.1 and 367.6 ng/dl, respectively. The prevalence of polycythemia in men on testosterone replacement was 11.2% vs 1.7% in men on clomiphene citrate (p = 0.0003). This significance remained on logistic regression after correcting for age, site, smoking history and pretreatment hematocrit. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of polycythemia in men treated with clomiphene citrate was markedly lower than that in men on testosterone replacement therapy. The improvement in absolute serum testosterone levels was similar to that in men on testosterone replacement. There is no significant risk of polycythemia in men treated with clomiphene citrate for hypogonadism.

CASE HISTORY: A group of 39, 19-22-month-old Friesian bulls were administered an ivermectin/closantel anthelmintic via intended S/C injection in the ischiorectal fossa on 15 June 2017 (Day 0). Over the next 50 days, 22 affected bulls presented various degrees of anorexia, abdominal pain and urine dribbling. Seventeen bulls were examined by transrectal ultrasonography which revealed urinary bladder distension in all 17, and peritoneal fluid accumulation in some. Overall, eight bulls died or were subjected to euthanasia. On-farm postmortem examination of three bulls revealed urinary bladder rupture. CLINICAL FINDINGS: On Day 50 one affected live bull was admitted to Massey University for further investigation. This bull continuously dribbled urine and had an overtly distended urinary bladder as determined by rectal palpation and ultrasonography. PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Postmortem examination of this bull revealed a markedly distended urinary bladder, massive subcapsular and pericapsular renal oedema with retroperitoneal fluid accumulation, minimal hydronephrosis and no evidence of mechanical urinary outflow obstruction. The right ischiorectal fossa contained multifocal areas of tissue fibrosis that extended into areas innervated by the distal cutaneous branch of the pudendal nerve and the pelvic nerve. Histopathological changes consisted of extensive fibrosis, myonecrosis and neurodegeneration, and evidence of granulation tissue and inflammation at the putative injection site and in surrounding tissues. DIAGNOSIS: A local inflammatory reaction at the presumed injection site together with localised peripheral neurodegeneration and myelopathy may have led to detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia causing urine retention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These cases of urine retention and bladder rupture in cattle were of putative iatrogenic origin. Veterinarians should be aware of this rare complication after S/C injections in the ischiorectal fossa.

BACKGROUND: Selective agents able to locate and identify unique targets represent a crucial aspect of modern pharmacology. The exclusive location of Sodium-Glucose co-Transporter-2 (SGLUT2) on kidneys prompt companies to develop SGLT2 inhibitors that today are the latest class of drugs for diabetes treatment. In particular, canagliflozin blocks the re-absorption of glucose in the kidney lowering blood glucose levels by increasing glucose excretion. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 61-year old woman who developed an intense and severe pruritus during the treatment with canagliflozin. Clinical and laboratory findings excluded the presence of systemic or skin diseases able to induce pruritus. The discontinuation of canagliflozin and the treatment with pioglitazone/metformin fixed combination induced a remission of pruritus. CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes the need to consider pruritus as a differential diagnosis during the treatment with canagliflozin.

Salbutamol is a beta2 adrenergic agonist widely prescribed in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. The main side effects associated with its use are tachycardia and tremor. Myoclonus is an involuntary, irregular, abrupt, brief and sudden muscular contraction, which can be generalized, focal or multifocal. We report the case of a 61-year-old patient presenting with myoclonus difficult to treat who showed improvement only after the definitive discontinuation of the beta2 adrenergic agonist. We describe the clinical findings, the interventions, and the outcomes related to the onset of myoclonus secondary to the use of salbutamol, as well as the possible genesis and importance of this adverse effect. We used the CARE guidelines to delineate the clinical case. Although myoclonus secondary to the use of different drugs has been described in the literature, as far as we know this is the fourth report of salbutamol-induced myoclonus to date.

CASE DESCRIPTION A 14-year-old 4.1-kg (9.02-lb) male harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) was evaluated because of vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and weight loss (decrease of 0.35 kg [0.77 lb]) of 4 weeks' duration. The bird had previously been treated orally with fenbendazole after the initial onset of clinical signs. CLINICAL FINDINGS An initial CBC revealed marked heteropenia and anemia, but whole-body contrast-enhanced CT images and other diagnostic test findings were unremarkable. Clinical signs persisted, and additional diagnostic testing failed to reveal the cause. During celiotomy, a biopsy specimen of the duodenum was obtained for histologic examination, which revealed lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Prior to histopathologic diagnosis of IBD, barium sulfate administered via gavage resulted in a temporary improvement of clinical signs. Following diagnosis of IBD, corticosteroid administration was initiated in conjunction with antifungal prophylaxis. Cessation of vomiting and a return to normal appetite occurred within 3 days. Fifteen months after cessation of corticosteroid treatment, the eagle continued to do well. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this was the first report of diagnosis and management of IBD in an avian species. For the eagle of the present report, results of several diagnostic tests increased clinical suspicion of IBD, but histologic examination of an intestinal biopsy specimen was required for definitive diagnosis. Although successful in this case, steroid administration in avian species must be carefully considered. Conclusive evidence of fenbendazole toxicosis was not obtained, although it was highly suspected in this bird.

BACKGROUND: Children, adolescents, and young adults with very high-risk (VHR) B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have poor outcomes, and novel therapies are needed for this subgroup. The AALL1131 study evaluated postinduction therapy using cyclophosphamide (CPM), etoposide (ETOP), and clofarabine (CLOF) for patients with VHR B-ALL. METHODS: Patients who were 1 to 30 years old and had VHR B-ALL received modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster therapy after induction and were randomized to 1) CPM, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, vincristine (VCR), and pegaspargase (control arm), 2) CPM, ETOP, VCR, and pegaspargase (experimental arm 1), or 3) CPM, ETOP, CLOF (30 mg/m(2) /d x 5), VCR, and pegaspargase (experimental arm 2) during the second half of consolidation and delayed intensification. RESULTS: The rates of grade 4/5 infections and grade 3/4 pancreatitis were significantly increased in experimental arm 2. The dose of CLOF was, therefore, reduced to 20 mg/m(2) /d x 5, and myeloid growth factor was required after CLOF administration. Despite these changes, 4 of 39 patients (10.3%) developed grade 4 infections, with 1 of these patients developing a grade 5 acute kidney injury attributed to CLOF, whereas only 1 of 46 patients (2.2%) in experimental arm 1 developed grade 4 infections, and there were no grade 4/5 infections in the control arm (n = 20). Four patients in experimental arm 2 had prolonged cytopenias for >60 days, whereas none did in the control arm or experimental arm 1. Counts failed to recover for 2 of these patients, one having a grade 5 acute kidney injury and the other removed from protocol therapy; both events occurred 92 days after the start of consolidation part 2. CONCLUSIONS: In AALL1131, CLOF, administered with CPM and ETOP, was associated with unacceptable toxicity. Cancer 2018;124:1150-9. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

Rigler sign is a double wall sign suggesting pneumoperitoneum and intestinal perforation, and it needs emergency surgical treatment. Early diagnosis of intestinal perforation by clinical symptoms, presence of Rigler sign in abdominal radiography, and then early surgical treatment can reduce mortality. Here, we report a patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome who underwent liver transplant and then developed posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease and received chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximab. She was referred to the emergency department due to abdominal distension with positive Rigler sign in abdominal radiography; intraoperative findings revealed intestinal perforation. Pediatricians and surgeons should be aware of Rigler sign so that it is diagnosed early and emergency surgical treatment can be performed.
29714705	2018/12/12	Cetylpyridinium	Tooth Erosion	Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	Potential erosive effect of mouthrinses on enamel and dentin.	This in vitro study measured the pH values, titratable acidity (TA), and erosive potential of commercially available mouthrinses. A pH analysis of 6 mouthrinses (Listerine Total Care, Listerine Ultraclean, Listerine Original, Crest Pro-Health, Scope Classic, and ACT Total Care) was performed using a calibrated pH meter, and the neutralizable acidity was measured by titrating the mouthwashes against 0.1 M of sodium hydroxide. A gravimetric analysis was performed by submerging human enamel and dentin specimens in 5 mL of each mouthrinse for a total of 2 weeks. Specimens were weighed on a calibrated analytical balance at baseline, 24 hours, 48 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks, and finally the loss of mass was calculated. The differences in erosive potential among the 6 mouthrinses were verified using nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Mann- Whitney). The level of significance was set at 0.05. The mouthrinses were found to have the following mean pH/ TA values: Crest Pro-Health, 7.05/0.00; ACT Total Care, 6.31/5.44; Scope Classic, 5.18/0.42; Listerine Original, 3.98/9.26; Listerine Total Care, 3.43/5.88; and Listerine Ultraclean, 3.87/10.36. A significant correlation between pH and TA was observed for this dataset (P > 0.0001). No statistically significant difference in enamel loss among the groups was observed (P = 0.0631). However, a significant difference in dentin loss was observed among the 6 mouthrinses (P = 0.0011). Within the limitations of this in vitro study, it can be concluded that some mouthrinses have a pH lower than the critical pH of enamel and dentin. There is a significant association between acidic pH values and higher TA. Some of the tested mouthrinses presented an erosive potential on dentin.

Drug induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is a rare blistering disease that has been shown to be associated with the use of various medications. Although rarely seen together, some of the medications associated with LABD can lead to the syndrome drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which presents with fever, cutaneous eruption, and multi-organ involvement. We present a patient who developed fever and a generalized vesiculobullous eruption after recently starting amlodipine and meloxicam. Initial laboratory tests demonstrated elevated liver function tests, leukocystosis, and eosinophilia. Histopathologic examination of the punch biopsy revealed a bulla with sub-epidermal split and numerous neutrophils. Direct immunofluorescence demonstrated broad deposition of IgA along the dermal-epidermal junction. These findings were consistent with an overlap between LABD and DRESS. Drug induced LABD and DRESS are independently both rare diseases. It is even more uncommon to see the two concurrently in the same patient. In this patient, these two conditions were thought to be triggered by either amlodipine or meloxicam. Given the high mortality rate associated with DRESS, it is important to recognize the presentation and initiate the appropriate treatment plan as soon as possible.

29073690	2019/1/8	Lamotrigine	Infant, Premature, Diseases	Journal Article	1	1	1	1	0	Fetal Valproate Syndrome - Still a Problem Today!	Introduction Fetal exposition to valproate can lead to a cluster of facial dysmorphism, congenital anomalies and neurodevelopmental retardation. Case Report In this report we describe 2 cases of fetal valproate syndrome. In the first case, the gravida had a valproate medication before and during pregnancy with additional folic acid. She delivered a male premature infant at 25+2 weeks of gestation due to preterm labor and rupture of the membranes. Physical examination showed even in the premature infant typical signs of fetal valproate syndrome with trigonocephaly, epicanthal folds, broad root of the nose, low-set ears, thin upper lip and anteverted nares. In the second case, the gravida was under antiepileptic therapy with valproate and lamotrigine before and during pregnancy without any prophylaxis with folic acid. Sonographic examination during pregnancy diagnosed a spina bifida, Chiari II malformation and clubfeet. A female newborn was delivered at 39+4 weeks of gestation. Besides the prenatally detected anomalies, facial dysmorphism including microcephaly, low-set ears, thin upper lip and shallow philtrum were seen after birth. Conclusion Valproate, a widely used anticonvulsant medication, is known for its teratogenic effects. The risk of congenital anomalies is even higher in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. Therefore, the avoidance of valproate or at least supplementation with a high dose prophylactic folic acid before and during pregnancy is highly recommended for women with epilepsy.
29782299	2018/11/8	Timolol	Lupus Erythematosus, Cutaneous	Case Reports_and_Journal Article_and_Review	1	1	0	0	0	Drug-induced Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Caused by a Topical Beta Blocker - Timolol.	Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DI-LE) is an autoimmune condition secondary to a recent pharmacological intervention. There are no established specific diagnostic criteria for DI-LE, and the disease is recognized based on the medical history of the patient. Typically, the onset is closely related to a recent drug exposure, and the disease terminates after discontinuation of the inducing factor. The most frequent form of DI-LE is drug-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (DI-SCLE). There has been an increasing number of drugs which are suspected to provoke SCLE lesions. Previously, systemic beta-blockers (antiarrhythmics and antihypertensives) were shown to be inducing factors of SCLE, however data regarding its topical usage are lacking in the literature. We present the case of a 78-year-old woman who developed annular polycyclic erythema in sun-exposed areas of the skin, four weeks after an initiation of topical timolol treatment of glaucoma. A resolution of cutaneous manifestations within only a few weeks after a cessation of the agent confirmed a clinical suspicion of drug-induced SCLE.
30826782	2019/6/14	Denosumab	Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	1	1	2	c-ANCA vasculitis after initiation of denosumab.	Denosumab is a fully human antibody to receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and it is administered every 6 months in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) at high risk for fracture. Adverse effects of denosumab include musculoskeletal pain, hypercholesterolaemia, symptomatic hypocalcaemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw and cutaneous events such as angioedema, cellulitis and pustular dermatitis. While the possibility of vasculitis was mentioned in the product Monograph as well as in the WHO Newsletter, this is the first case, to our knowledge, of cytoplasmic-ANCA (c-ANCA) associated vasculitis officially published in the literature. (1 2) The pathogenic mechanisms behind drug-induced vasculitis remain to be defined and appear to be multifactorial. Once suspicion for drug-induced vasculitis arises, the offending agent should be discontinued and immunosuppressive therapy should be initiated according to the severity of organ involvement to inhibit progression to severe, irreversible disease. As new medications continue to be developed, the number of agents causing drug-induced vasculitis is expected to increase.

"BACKGROUND: Unexpected serious adverse drug reactions (sADRs) affecting patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were identified by study co-authors. These included pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) after administration of the Eprex formulation of epoetin or the epoetin biosimilar HX575 and fatal anaphylaxis associated with peginesatide, an erythropoietin receptor agonist. We developed and applied a structured framework to describe these sADRs, including root cause analyses and eradication efforts. METHODS: A 10-step framework termed ""ANTICIPATE,"" focusing on signal identification, incidence, causality, and eradication guided our evaluations. RESULTS: Initial cases were identified by a hematologist (Eprex), clinical study monitors (HX575), and 4 nurses (peginesatide). The number of persons with individual ADRs was 13 PRCA cases for epoetin, 2 antibody-mediated PRCA cases for HX575, and 5 fatal anaphylaxis cases for peginesatide. Initial incidence estimates per 1000 treated persons were 0.27 for Eprex-associated PRCA, 11 for HX575-associated PRCA, and 0.38 for peginesatide fatalities. Likely causes were subcutaneous administration of epoetin formulated with polysorbate 80 (Eprex), tungsten leaching from pins included in product syringes (HX575), and inclusion of a phenol stabilizer (peginesatide). Eradication strategies included restricting Eprex administration to the intravenous route, excluding tungsten from HX575 syringes, and for peginesatide, proposed eradication was to return to single-dose vials without preservatives. CONCLUSION: Although the number of cases of each sADR was small, eradication was successful for 2 sADRs, and a proposed eradication was developed for a third sADR. The structured framework used to describe the above 3 sADRs in patients with CKD can also be used in other clinical settings."

Intrathecal chemotherapy may be complicated with the development of myelopathies or toxic radiculopathies. This myeloradicular involvement, of toxic character, is unpredictable, since these patients have repeatedly received Intrathecal chemotherapy with the same drugs without apparent injury. The toxic effect should be mainly attributed to Cytarabine and not to methotrexate, since the central nervous system lacks Cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that degrades Cytarabine. We report two patients, an 18-year-old woman and a 16 years old male, who received systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine) for the treatment of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia and developed, in relation to this procedure, a spinal subacute combined degeneration. They had a proprioceptive and motor alteration of the lower extremities and neuroimaging showed selective rear and side spinal cord hyper intensity produced by central axonopathy. Two weeks later the woman developed a quadriplegia and the young man a flaccid paraplegia due to added root involvement.

OBJECTIVES: To compare toxicity reporting between patients and clinicians in the case of systemic chemotherapy for urothelial carcinoma. METHODS: Between June 2013 and March 2016, 100 urothelial carcinoma patients received two courses of chemotherapy of gemcitabine plus cisplatin or gemcitabine plus carboplatin, and they were prospectively enrolled in the present study. During chemotherapy, patients answered European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30 quality-of-life questionnaires, including four toxicity-related symptoms (appetite loss, nausea, constipation and diarrhea). Clinicians evaluated adverse events using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Differences of toxicity reporting were compared between patients and clinicians. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to investigate potential factors for underreporting by clinicians. RESULTS: Toxicity underreporting was most frequently for diarrhea (44%), followed by appetite loss (39%), constipation (33%) and nausea (22%). In total, toxicity underreporting was observed in 72% of patients. Background-adjusted logistic regression analyses showed pretreatment quality-of-life items of global, symptomatic scores to be predictors for toxicity underreporting by clinicians. The limitations of the present study included its retrospective nature and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Toxicity underreporting by clinicians is frequent in urothelial carcinoma patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. Pretreatment quality-of-life evaluation is essential not only for quality-of-life evaluation, but also to identify potential individuals at risk for toxicity underreporting.

Upgaze or sustained elevation of the eyes, is an alteration of ocular motility initially described in hypoxic coma. We report a 65-year-old woman admitted with hypotension and alteration of sensorium due to the ingestion of 9.5 g of Bupropion. She presented two seizures of short duration, without epileptic activity on the EEG. She had a persistent asynchronous myoclonus in extremities, tachycardia and prolonged Q-t. She suffered a cardiac arrest caused by asystole, which recovered quickly in five minutes. At that moment, upgaze appeared, associated with a persistent ocular opening, which persisted for days, but finally disappeared, without remission of coma. A magnetic resonance imaging done at the eighth day, showed hyperintensity of the oval center and corpus callosum which disappeared in a new imaging study done 30 days later, where images of hypoxia in the basal nuclei and cortex appeared. The patient died forty seven days after admission. Up-gaze is an ominous oculomotor alteration linked to an important but incomplete damage in the cerebral cortex, a condition that perverts some sequences of the ocular opening, reversing the Bell phenomenon and producing eyelid retraction.

BACKGROUND: Combined use of a retinoid and antimicrobial is recommended for acne, however, local tolerability issues may compromise patient adherence and treatment outcome. OBJECTIVES: This multicentre, single-blinded controlled study was designed to determine whether modified adapalene/benzoyl peroxide (A/BPO, Epiduo((R)), Galderma, France) regimens improve local tolerability during the first four weeks of treatment without impairing efficacy at Week 12. MATERIALS & METHODS: In total, 120 subjects with mild-to-moderate acne received, during the first four weeks, A/BPO daily overnight (A/BPO-EN), A/BPO daily for three hours (A/BPO-3h), A/BPO daily overnight and a provided moisturizer lotion (A/BPO-moisturizer), or A/BPO every other night (A/BPO-EoN). Local tolerance assessments included signs and symptoms, global worst score (GWS), and total sum score (TSS). Efficacy was assessed based on lesion counts, investigator global assessment (IGA), and total lesion count reduction. Adherence, subject satisfaction, and overall safety were also assessed. RESULTS: The mean TSS was significantly reduced at Week 1 with A/BPO-EoN vs. A/BPO-EN (p<0.05), and A/BPO-EoN led to the lowest GWS and a decrease in severity of stinging/burning and erythema (p<0.05). The A/BPO-moisturizer regimen prevented dryness and scaling compared with the A/BPO-EN regimen. The median decrease in lesions from baseline was similar in all groups: up to 67% for total, 72% for inflammatory, and 70% for non-inflammatory lesion counts. Adherence, IGA, patient satisfaction, and overall safety were excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Modulating treatment regimens during the first four weeks improved local tolerability without impacting overall efficacy outcome after 12 weeks and may improve treatment adherence during the first weeks of therapy.

29565276	2018/9/18	Niacin	Low Tension Glaucoma	Journal Article	1	0	0	0	0	Dietary Niacin and Open-Angle Glaucoma: The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.	Glaucoma is a leading cause of loss of sight. High intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most critical risk factor. However, glaucoma develops even within a normal IOP range. Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is more common in Asia, whereas high tension glaucoma is more common in Western countries. The pathogenesis of glaucoma, especially NTG, is poorly understood. We evaluated the correlation between dietary nutrient intake and glaucoma using data from subjects >/=40 years old from the ongoing, nationwide, population-based study, the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V (2008-2012). Dietary intake was determined using the 24 h recall method. Fiber (g/day), ash (g/day), calcium (mg/day), phosphorus (mg/day), iron (mg/day), sodium (mg/day), potassium (mg/day), beta-Carotene (mug/day), retinol (mug/day), vitamin A (mug Retinol Equivalents/day), thiamine (mg/day), riboflavin (mg/day), niacin (mg/day), and vitamin C (mg/day) were included in nutrient intake data. All nutrient intake was divided into quartiles. The mean IOP did not differ according to quartiles from any nutrients (all p > 0.05). After adjusting for age, gender, income status, education level, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diabetes, hypertension, IOP, and total energy, the intake of niacin was associated with glaucoma (p = 0.013). Among subjects with IOP </= 21 mmHg, only niacin was related to glaucoma in a multivariate analysis (p = 0.022). Dietary nutrient intake was associated with open-angle glaucoma independent of IOP. Individuals with NTG showed lower intake of niacin among nutrients. This finding suggests the possibility that proper diet counseling may be another modifiable factor, aside from IOP, particularly among patients with NTG.

Proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib have been used effectively to treat patients who have certain hematologic malignancies. Proteasome activity is elevated in the heart, and potent inhibition results in accumulation of misfolded intracellular protein aggregates and apoptosis. Heart failure, conduction disturbances, and premature atherosclerosis have been associated with bortezomib therapy. We describe the case of a 49-year-old man who was taking bortezomib for graft-versus-host disease, when he developed cardiac tamponade and needed emergency pericardiocentesis. At that time, there was no evidence of graft-versus-host disease. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pericardial effusion without underlying cardiac dysfunction has been reported in relation to bortezomib therapy. The diagnosis of pericardial effusion during bortezomib therapy, the absence of other causative agents-including graft-versus-host disease-and no recurrence of pericardial effusion after discontinuing bortezomib therapy suggest that bortezomib caused our patient's tamponade.

The purpose of present study was to infer the potential effects of testosterone increase in some male-based childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Tourette syndrome. Thus, the influence of early postnatal androgen exposure upon the neurobehaviors and its possible neural basis were investigated in the study. Male pup rats received consecutive 14-day testosterone propionate (TP) subcutaneous injection from postnatal day (PND) 7. The TP treatment produced the hyperactive motor behavior and grooming behavior as well as the increased levels of dopamine, tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter in the mesodopaminergic system and the elevated levels of serotonin in the nucleus accumbens, without affecting the levels of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, norepinephrine and histamine in the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens of PND21 and PND49 rats. Dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol was administered to the early postnatal TP-exposed PND21 and PND49 male rats 30 min prior to open field test. Haloperidol significantly ameliorated the motor behavioral and grooming behavioral defects induced by early postnatal TP exposure. The results demonstrated that early postnatal androgen exposure significantly disturbed the brain activity of developing male rats via enhancing the mesodopaminergic activity. It was suggested that abnormal increments of testosterone levels during the early postnatal development might be a potential risk factor for the incidence of some male-based childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders by affecting the mesodopaminergic system.

28572006	2018/11/28	Nicotine	Seizures, Febrile	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Electroencephalographic and biochemical long-lasting abnormalities in animal model of febrile seizure.	Febrile seizures (FS) are convulsions associated with high body temperature. It has a high incidence in children from the age of 6months to 5years and may have adverse consequences in adulthood. The experimental model of FS could be induced in animals via hyperthermia. The present study was designed to investigate persistent electroencephalographic (EEG), neurochemical and behavioral alterations in adult animals that had experienced complex FS at their immature age. EEG signals were obtained from the cortex of both FS and control normothermic groups of animals. A spectrophotometric assay was carried out to determine oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, reduced glutathione) and acetylcholinesterase activity in the cortex and hippocampus of FS and control animals. Behavioral assessment of seizure threshold and severity were investigated via a sub-convulsive dose of nicotine in adult animals. Alterations in the oxidant/antioxidant system and AChE activity were obtained in the cortex and hippocampus of FS animals in comparison to control animals. EEG spectral analysis displayed significant changes in all EEG frequency bands. A decrease in seizure latency and an increase in seizure severity were also observed. The present study provides evidence for long-lasting abnormalities in the cortex and hippocampus of adult animals subjected to complex FS at their developmental age, which may be correlated to the underlying mechanism of epileptogenesis and its related co-morbidities.

BACKGROUND: This phase Ib study evaluated afatinib plus vinorelbine in patients with advanced solid tumours overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or human EGFR 2 (HER2). METHODS: Maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) were determined for afatinib (20, 40 or 50 mg, once daily) combined with standard intravenous vinorelbine (part A; 25 mg m(-2) per week) or oral vinorelbine (part B; 60 mg m(-2) per week, increased to 80 mg m(-2) per week at week 3). Secondary end points for expanded MTD cohorts included assessments of safety, pharmacokinetics, tumour response and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The afatinib MTD was 40 mg with intravenous (MTD(A)) and oral (MTD(B)) vinorelbine. The most frequent cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities were febrile neutropenia and diarrhoea, consistent with individual safety profiles of vinorelbine and afatinib. Common treatment-related adverse events included: diarrhoea (92.7%), asthenia (76.4%), nausea (63.6%), neutropenia (56.4%) and vomiting (54.5%). No notable pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. Best overall tumour response was stable disease in part A (16 out of 28 patients), and partial response in part B (3 out of 27 patients). Median PFS was 14.6 and 15.9 weeks for patients treated at the MTD(A) and MTD(B), including dose-escalation and expansion cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Afatinib in combination with intravenous or oral vinorelbine demonstrated a manageable safety profile and antitumour activity at the MTD of 40 mg per day.

METHODS: Maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) were determined for afatinib (20, 40 or 50 mg, once daily) combined with standard intravenous vinorelbine (part A; 25 mg m(-2) per week) or oral vinorelbine (part B; 60 mg m(-2) per week, increased to 80 mg m(-2) per week at week 3). Secondary end points for expanded MTD cohorts included assessments of safety, pharmacokinetics, tumour response and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The afatinib MTD was 40 mg with intravenous (MTD(A)) and oral (MTD(B)) vinorelbine. The most frequent cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities were febrile neutropenia and diarrhoea, consistent with individual safety profiles of vinorelbine and afatinib. Common treatment-related adverse events included: diarrhoea (92.7%), asthenia (76.4%), nausea (63.6%), neutropenia (56.4%) and vomiting (54.5%). No notable pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. Best overall tumour response was stable disease in part A (16 out of 28 patients), and partial response in part B (3 out of 27 patients). Median PFS was 14.6 and 15.9 weeks for patients treated at the MTD(A) and MTD(B), including dose-escalation and expansion cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Afatinib in combination with intravenous or oral vinorelbine demonstrated a manageable safety profile and antitumour activity at the MTD of 40 mg per day.

We report the case of a 50-year-old woman with anorexigen-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension treated with epoprostenol, who presented with Trousseau's sign, leading to the diagnosis of severe hypocalcemia for which substitution was started (initially orally, followed by intravenous substitution). After further analysis, we assume that epoprostenol-induced diarrhea caused malabsorption (as other reasons were excluded), leading to nutritional osteomalacia with secondary hyperparathyroidism. We discovered that even more severe hypocalcemia was induced by the treatment with the anti-osteoporotic drug denosumab, which was started after the diagnosis of osteoporosis on bone densitometry. In our opinion, clinicians have to be aware that in patients with malabsorption, antiresorptive therapy can induce dangerous and even life-threatening hypocalcemia, even in patients with normal renal function.

29794694	2018/11/7	Tamoxifen	Intraoperative Complications	Journal Article	1	0	0	0	0	Does Hormone Therapy Use Increase Perioperative Complications in Abdominally Based Microsurgical Breast Reconstruction?	BACKGROUND: The use of hormone therapy (tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors) has been shown to increase venous thromboembolism. As breast cancer patients undergoing microsurgical breast reconstruction are often receiving hormone therapy, it is unclear whether this increased thrombotic risk is associated with increased flap loss. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on patients undergoing abdominally based microsurgical breast reconstruction at an academic institution from 2004 to 2015. Patients were divided by use of hormone therapy at the time of surgery. Complication rates, including complete or partial flap loss and overall complications, were compared and analyzed using univariate and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among a total of 853 patients (1253 flaps), 193 patients (269 flaps) were receiving hormone therapy and 660 patients (984 flaps) were not. Patients on hormone therapy had higher rates of previous breast surgery, advanced cancer stage, chemoradiation before reconstruction, and delayed and unilateral reconstruction. There were no statistically significant differences between hormone therapy patients and nontherapy patients in complete flap loss (1.0 percent versus 1.1 percent) and partial flap loss (2.2 percent versus 1.5 percent). Hypertension and previous breast surgery were the only independent risk factors for minor complications (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95 percent CI, 1.3 to 3.6; p = 0.005; and adjusted OR, 1.8; 95 percent CI, 1.2 to 2.7; p = 0.009, respectively) and overall complications (adjusted OR, 2.2; 95 percent CI, 1.3 to 3.7; p = 0.004; and adjusted OR, 1.9; 95 percent CI, 1.3 to 3.0; p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hormone therapy was not associated with a higher incidence of complete or partial flap loss or overall complications. The authors propose an individualized approach to the preoperative cessation of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

PURPOSE: To report a patient with fluctuating refraction following the use of oral topiramate. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old male patient was diagnosed elsewhere with sudden-onset-acquired myopia, high intraocular pressure, and bilateral angle closure glaucoma for which he underwent laser peripheral iridotomy in both eyes and was started on topical antiglaucoma medications and topical steroids following laser peripheral iridotomy. He was referred for ultrasound biomicroscopy, which showed bilateral ciliary effusion. Ultrasound of eyes revealed choroidal thickening. On further questioning, he was noted to have taken oral topiramate for 7 days, which he stopped a week before the ocular symptoms. He was started on atropine, on which the acquired myopia resolved, the anterior chamber deepened, and the intraocular pressure came down. After 4 days, he developed acquired hyperopia in the left eye. Neurosensory retinal detachment at the posterior pole was documented with optical coherence tomography. The fluorescein angiography showed few ink-blot leaks and one smokestack leak in the left eye. The neurosensory detachment resolved spontaneously with an uncorrected visual acuity of 6/6 in either eye. CONCLUSION: A unique case of central serous chorioretinopathy following oral intake of topiramate is presented. This patient had also received laser peripheral iridotomy and topical steroids following the peripheral iridotomy.

30773659	2019/3/29	Latanoprost	Cicatrix	Journal Article	1	0	0	0	0	An in vitro study of scarring formation mediated by human Tenon fibroblasts: Effect of Y-27632, a Rho kinase inhibitor.	Scar formation is the most common cause for failure of glaucoma filtration surgery because of increased fibroblast proliferation and activation. We have now examined the effect of Y-27632, a Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, on postsurgical scarring formation in human Tenon fibroblasts (HTFs). Collagen gel contraction assay was used to compare contractility activity of Y-27632 with several antiglaucoma drugs. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to examine expression of scar formation-related factors. We found that Y-27632 inhibited collagen gel contraction, as well as alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin expression; these were promoted by treatment with latanoprost, timolol, or transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. To investigate the effect of Y-27632 in postsurgical scarring, we mimicked TGF-beta secretion by stimulating HTFs with TGF-beta prior to Y-27632 treatment. HTFs cultured in the presence of TGF-beta significantly increased gel contraction. In contrast, when HTFs were treated with 10muM Y-27632, contraction was significantly inhibited. Furthermore, Y-27632 reduced TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. These results suggest that ROCK inhibitors may inhibit fibrosis by inhibiting transdifferentiation of Tenon fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and by inhibiting TGF-beta signalling after surgery through mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway suppression. These results implicate that ROCK inhibitors may improve outcomes after filtering surgery with a potential antiscarring effect, while latanoprost and timolol may induce fibrosis. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Scar formation is the primary cause of failure after glaucoma filtration surgery. A ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, has been introduced as a novel potential antiglaucoma treatment to reduce intraocular pressure. The aim of our study was to elucidate the effect of Y-27632 on scarring formation after glaucoma filtration surgery, in direct comparison with other antiglaucoma drugs. Our findings thus suggested that Y-27632 may inhibit fibrosis and improve outcome after glaucoma filtration surgery through inhibition of transdifferentiation of Tenon fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and the TGF-beta and MAPK signalling after surgery, while latanoprost and timolol may induce fibrosis.
30744989	2019/9/3	Zanamivir	Behavioral Symptoms	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Association of severe abnormal behavior and acetaminophen with/without neuraminidase inhibitors.	BACKGROUND: Even though abnormal behavior related with influenza and neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) has been discussed, the risks of acetaminophen and co-administration of NI and acetaminophen have not been examined. This study assesses those risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of patients with influenza who present with severe abnormal behavior are reported by physicians of all clinics and hospitals throughout Japan. The numbers of people diagnosed as having influenza, whether prescribed NI and acetaminophen or not, were extracted from the National Database of Electronic Medical Claims (NDBEMC). The study period was from September 2009 to March 2016. RESULTS: We found two consistent results among four combinations of age class and severity. The one was that patients who did not use NI or acetaminophen showed significantly higher incidence of abnormal behavior than zanamivir with acetaminophen, another one was that patients with oseltamivir only has higher incidence than zanamivir with acetaminophen. Concerning about acetaminophen, the use of it significantly decrease risk for severe and the most severe instances in 5-9-year-old patients with laninamivir and the severe instances in 10-19-year-old patients with zanamivir. DISCUSSION: We also demonstrated that acetaminophen alone or co-administered with NI does not seem to raise the risk of abnormal behavior in influenza patients.

Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody licensed for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It is known to increase the potential risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). There is current debate in the literature regarding its association with malignant melanoma. Herein, we report a case of a 55-year old lady with RRMS for whom natalizumab therapy was being considered by her neurologist. Her medical history included a choroidal melanoma which had undergone successful treatment. Additionally, in this case study we discuss the issues regarding malignant melanoma risk and recurrence with natalizumab treatment.
29991348	2019/4/10	Carbamazepine	Hypokalemia	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Walking hyponatremia syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion secondary to carbamazepine use: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Severe hyponatremia is rare when carbamazepine is used as monotherapy. It is common to encounter this imbalance in the hospital setting, but rare in the ambulatory one. Here, we present a case of hyponatremia secondary to carbamazepine use in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Guatemalan woman presented to our outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of left knee pain. One month prior, our patient had previously consulted with an outside physician, who prescribed her with 300 mg of carbamazepine, 5 mg of prednisone every 24 hours, and ibuprofen every 8 hours as needed. The symptoms did not resolve and our patient had increased the dose to 600 mg of carbamazepine and 20 mg of prednisone 7 days prior. Our patient complained of left knee pain, fatigue, and bilateral lower limb cramps. No pertinent medical history was recorded and her vital signs were within normal limits. A physical examination was non-contributory, only multiple port-wine stains in the upper and lower extremities associated with mild hypertrophy of the calves, more prominent on the right side. Laboratory studies revealed: a serum sodium level of 119 mmol/L, potassium level of 2.9 mmol/L, thyroid-secreting hormone of 1.76 mIU/m, thyroxine of 14.5 ng/dL, and serum osmolality at 247 mmol/kg. No neurologic or physical disabilities were recorded. In the emergency department, her electrolyte imbalance was corrected and other diagnostic studies revealed: a urinary sodium level of 164 mmol/L and osmolality at 328 mmol/kg. Our patient was diagnosed with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion secondary to carbamazepine use, hypokalemia secondary to corticosteroid therapy, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. Carbamazepine was discontinued, fluid restriction ordered, and hypokalemia was corrected. One week after discharge, our patient no longer felt fatigued, the cramps were not present, and her left knee pain had mildly improved with acetaminophen use and local nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory cream. Electrolyte studies revealed a sodium level of 138 mmol/L, potassium level of 4.6 mmol/L, and serum osmolality at 276 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia can be misdiagnosed if not recognized promptly; suspicion should be high when risk factors are present and the patient has been prescribed antiepileptic drugs. Presence of mild symptoms such as fatigue or dizziness should lead to suspicion and subsequent laboratory testing. Patients can suffer from neurologic complications if the imbalance is not corrected.

BACKGROUND: Various immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been reported to be associated with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We report a case of a patient with lung cancer treated with nivolumab who developed a bullous eruption and give a systematic review of the literature on irAEs in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors for lung cancer. CASE REPORT: A patient with lung adenocarcinoma developed a non-specific skin lesion at the time of his cancer diagnosis followed by flare episodes until the eighth cycle of nivolumab, when he developed a bullous lupus. As the first eruption had started a few months after his cancer diagnosis and was exacerbated during immunotherapy, a paraneoplastic origin is discussed. Since the patient also presented with flares under nivolumab, we reviewed reported irAEs. No bullous lupus was found but to date, 33 cases of paraneoplastic lupus and two of lupus erythematosus have been reported. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first description of a bullous lupus exacerbated by nivolumab.

Elderly patients with insulin-treated diabetes present to primary care frequently with non-specific symptoms associated with hypoglycaemia.	"INTRODUCTION: We assessed if patients with known hypoglycaemia present on other occasions with non-specific symptoms associated with (but not diagnosed as) hypoglycaemia, potentially representing missed hypoglycaemia. METHODS: 335 primary care records (5/2/12-4/2/13) from patients aged >65 (79 on insulin, 85 on sulphonylureas, 121 on metformin only, 50 without diabetes) were assessed for hypoglycaemia episodes and consultations with non-specific symptoms, ""hypo clues"". RESULTS: 27/79(34%) insulin-treated patients had >1 documented hypoglycaemia episode, compared to 4/85(5%) sulphonylurea-treated patients, 2/121(2%) metformin-only treated patients, and none without diabetes, p<0.001. ""Hypo clue"" consultations were common: 1.37 consultations/patient/year in insulin-treated patients, 0.98/patient/year in sulphonylurea-treated, 0.97/patient/year in metformin only-treated, and 0.78/patient/year in non-diabetic patients, p=0.34. In insulin-treated patients with documented hypoglycaemia, 20/27(74%) attended on another occasion with a ""hypo clue"" symptom, compared to 21/52(40%) of those without hypoglycaemia, p=0.008. No significant difference in the other treatment groups. Nausea, falls and unsteadiness were the most discriminatory symptoms: 7/33(21%) with hypoglycaemia attended on another occasion with nausea compared to 14/302(5%) without hypoglycaemia, p=0.002; 10/33(30%) vs 36/302(12%) with falls, p=0.007; and 5/33(15%) vs 13/302(4%) with unsteadiness, p=0.023. CONCLUSIONS: Non-specific symptoms are common in those >65 years. In insulin-treated patients at high hypoglycaemia risk, nausea, falls and unsteadiness should prompt consideration of hypoglycaemia."

29532602	2019/3/20	Pantoprazole 	Jaundice	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	1	1	1	Pantoprazole-induced autoimmune chronic hepatitis.	BACKGROUND: Although very rare, pantoprazole can result in acute hepatitis. It has yet to be reported, however, that it can also cause chronic autoimmune hepatitis. AIM, METHOD AND RESULTS: We report the case of a patient in whom pantoprazole administration for 2 months was followed by acute liver injury with severe jaundice and features of autoimmunity. A liver biopsy revealed acute hepatocellular lesions associated with cholestasis, acute cholangitis and polymorphous inflammatory infiltration suggestive of drug-induced liver injury. The jaundice disappeared following discontinuation of the pantoprazole. There was, however, chronic autoimmune liver injury, with the occurrence of extensive liver fibrosis within a few months. This led to the administration of immunosuppressive agents, which led to progressive and complete recovery associated with the disappearance of autoantibodies. CONCLUSION: This observation further supports the notion that pantoprazole can induce acute hepatocellular hepatitis, and it strongly suggests that it may trigger acute cholangitis and autoimmune liver injury. This case also helps document that some drugs can induce chronic autoimmune hepatitis that can resolve with immunosuppressive treatment.

Report of two cases and literature review].	INTRODUCTION: Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is a rare complication of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This syndrome is mainly described following conditioning regiment with busulfan, cyclophosphamide and/or total body irradiation. CASE REPORTS: We report for the first time two cases of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome occurring lately after BeAM conditioning regiment (bendamustine, etoposide, aracytine, melphalan) for autologous stem cell transplantation in patients treated for malignant lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Our observations highlight the difficulty to diagnose this complication with often non-specific clinical presentation and possible delayed occurrence after to transplantation, but also the therapeutic challenges, defibrotide being the only agent currently efficient. Physiopathology and potential responsibility of bendamustine in the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome occurrence will be discussed.

OBJECTIVES: The management of hepatitis C has progressed from interferon-based therapy to oral direct acting antiviral therapy. Deranged lipid levels (total cholesterol, triglyceride) after treatment with interferon-based therapy are well known. There is a paucity of data on changes in lipid profile, glycemic parameters and alteration in quality of life with the newer regimen. This study was designed to assess the changes in lipid profile, glycemic parameters, quality of life in chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype 3 after treatment with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. METHODS: The study was a single-centre, prospective study, conducted at tertiary care hospital from January 2017 to December 2017. Fifty patients, who received sofosbuvir (400 mg) and daclatasvir (60 mg) orally once daily for a period of 12 weeks for chronic hepatitis C and genotype 3, were recruited. RESULTS: Total cholesterol levels (166.9 +/- 23.8 to 192.4 +/- 34.5 mg/dL, p-value < 0.0001) and low-density cholesterol (LDL) levels (100.9 +/- 22.8 to 121.6 +/- 37.2, p-value < 0.0001) were elevated after the treatment. A significant decrease in median levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was observed (5.57% to 5.41%, p-value < 0.002). Quality of life markedly improved in all domains, i.e. physical, physiological, environmental, and social relationships according to an abbreviated form of World Health Organization quality of life assessment named WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. Treatment was found to be effective with sustained virological response (SVR) achieved in 94% patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a substantial increment in total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir treatment though it achieved SVR in 94% of patients and improved their quality of life.

29921744	2018/10/3	Clozapine	Tachycardia, Paroxysmal	Case Reports	1	1	0	0	0	Clozapine-related Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia: a Case Report.	Clozapine is considered to be more effective than other antipsychotic drugs for treating treatmentresistant schizophrenia. However, side effects of clozapine include agranulocytosis and, less commonly, cardiovascular disease, which is occasionally fatal. We describe a 56-year-old woman who developed clozapine-related paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia during clozapine dose titration and had a recurrence despite being treated with verapamil. For treatment-resistant schizophrenia, a slow titration of the clozapine dose is necessary, and potential cardiac side-effects should be monitored.

28832211	2018/12/21	Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination	Ischemia	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Ischemic Hand Complications From Intra-Arterial Injection of Sublingual Buprenorphine/Naloxone Among Patients With Opioid Dependency.	BACKGROUND: Sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone, a common treatment for opioid dependence, is frequently abused by intravenous injection. Inadvertent intra-arterial injection of buprenorphine/naloxone can produce acute ischemic insult to the hand due to gelatin embolism. Our purpose was to review a series of these patients in order to describe the clinical entity, review the outcomes, and propose a rational treatment algorithm. METHODS: Clinical records of all patients evaluated by the hand surgery team between 2011 and 2015 for ischemia of the hand after buprenorphine/naloxone injection were reviewed. Treatment, complications, and amount of tissue loss were recorded. Patients presenting within 48 hours of the injection were treated with intravenous heparin for 5 days, followed by oral aspirin and clopidogrel for 30 days. Those presenting after 48 hours were treated with aspirin and clopidogrel only. RESULTS: Ten patients presented during the review period. Average follow-up time was 13 weeks. Eight had ischemia of the radial side of the hand, 1 of the ulnar side, and 1 had bilateral ischemia. Three patients were treated with intravenous heparin and 5 with oral agents. Two presented with dry gangrene and did not receive anticoagulation. All patients experienced tissue loss. There was no difference in outcome regardless of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing use of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid dependency, ischemic hand injuries will be seen with greater frequency. Whereas outcomes did not vary with treatment modality in this series, further study is needed to determine the most effective treatment of these injuries.
29309397	2018/9/18	Guanine	Osteoporotic Fractures	Comparative Study_and_Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	Assessment of bone mineral density in patients with cirrhosis treated with third-generation nucleos(t)ide analogues: comparison between tenofovir and entecavir.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Tenofovir and entecavir are nowadays the first-line treatment in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis. Both drugs were shown to be effective in HBV suppression and well tolerated. The effects of tenofovir on bone mineral density (BMD), however, were shown to worsen the rate of osteoporosis, which is already a common feature in cirrhosis. In contrast, entecavir seems to have no effect on mineral metabolism. The aim of our study was to compare the effects of nucleos(t)ide analogs on bone density in HBV-related cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourty-eight patients were treated with tenofovir and 22 patients were treated with entecavir, and were followed prospectively from 2008 to 2013. To evaluate BMD, laboratory examinations, dual-X-ray absorptiometry, and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool were assessed. RESULTS: During the study, no difference was found between the two groups in the plasmatic concentration of calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, or creatinine. Dual-X-ray absorptiometry showed no difference in the T-score and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool showed no significant difference in the 10-year risk of osteoporotic fractures in the two groups. On univariate and multivariate analyses, the only predictors of osteoporosis development were the prognostic scores of liver disease and BMI. CONCLUSION: Both tenofovir and entecavir are effective in treating HBV in cirrhotic patients. The known effects of tenofovir on BMD do not worsen osteoporotic fractures risk compared with entecavir in these patients.

OBJECTIVES: While tocilizumab may increase serum lipid levels, recent studies do not suggest a link between tocilizumab use and clinical cardiovascular risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: To compare cardiovascular safety of tocilizumab with abatacept, we conducted a cohort study using data from Medicare (2010-2013), IMS PharMetrics (2011-2014) and MarketScan (2011-6/2015). RA patients aged >/=18 years who newly started tocilizumab or abatacept entered the cohort on the day of their first use of tocilizumab or abatacept after a continuous enrollment period for >/=365 days. The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular endpoint of hospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke. To control for more than 60 confounders, tocilizumab starters were propensity score (PS)-matched to abatacept starters with a variable ratio of 1:3 within each database. A fixed-effects model combined database-specific hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: We included 6237 tocilizumab starters PS-matched to 14,685 abatacept starters in all three databases. Mean age was 72 years in Medicare, 51 in PharMetrics and 53 in MarketScan. The incidence rate of the composite cardiovascular events per 100 person-years ranged from 0.37 (PharMetrics) to 1.64 (Medicare) in the tocilizumab group and from 0.59 (PharMetrics) to 1.69 (Medicare) in the abatacept group. The risk of the composite cardiovascular events was similar between the two groups across all three databases, with a combined HR of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.55-1.22) in tocilizumab versus abatacept starters. CONCLUSIONS: This multi-database cohort study found no difference in the risk of cardiovascular events in RA patients who newly started tocilizumab versus abatacept.
30661105	2019/6/6	Cannabidiol	Dissociative Disorders	Journal Article_and_Randomized Controlled Trial	1	1	0	0	0	A randomised controlled trial of vaporised Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol alone and in combination in frequent and infrequent cannabis users: acute intoxication effects.	Access to cannabis and cannabinoid products is increasing worldwide for recreational and medicinal use. Two primary compounds within cannabis plant matter, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), are both psychoactive, but only THC is considered intoxicating. There is significant interest in potential therapeutic properties of these cannabinoids and of CBD in particular. Some research has suggested that CBD may ameliorate adverse effects of THC, but this may be dose dependent as other evidence suggests possible potentiating effects of THC by low doses of CBD. We conducted a randomised placebo controlled trial to examine the acute effects of these compounds alone and in combination when administered by vaporisation to frequent and infrequent cannabis users. Participants (n = 36; 31 male) completed 5 drug conditions spaced one week apart, with the following planned contrasts: placebo vs CBD alone (400 mg); THC alone (8 mg) vs THC combined with low (4 mg) or high (400 mg) doses of CBD. Objective (blind observer ratings) and subjective (self-rated) measures of intoxication were the primary outcomes, with additional indices of intoxication examined. CBD showed some intoxicating properties relative to placebo. Low doses of CBD when combined with THC enhanced, while high doses of CBD reduced the intoxicating effects of THC. The enhancement of intoxication by low-dose CBD was particularly prominent in infrequent cannabis users and was consistent across objective and subjective measures. Most effects were significant at p < .0001. These findings are important to consider in terms of recommended proportions of THC and CBD in cannabis plant matter whether used medicinally or recreationally and have implications for novice or less experienced cannabis users.Trial registration: ISRCTN Registry Identifier: ISRCTN24109245.

BACKGROUND: Studies suggesting a protective effect of estrogen in neurodegenerative diseases prompted us to investigate this relationship in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). METHODS: This case-control study evaluated the self-reported reproductive characteristics and estrogen of 150 women with PSP and 150 age-matched female controls who participated in the Environmental Genetic-PSP study. Conditional logistic regression models were generated to examine associations of PSP with estrogen. RESULTS: There was no association between years of estrogen exposure duration and PSP. There was a suggestion of an inverse association between composite estrogen score and PSP that did not reach statistical significance (P = .06). Any exposure to estrogen replacement therapy halved the risk of PSP (odds ratio = 0.52; 95% confidence interval = 0.30-0.92; P = .03). Among PSP cases, earlier age at menarche was associated with better performance on Hoehn and Yahr stage (beta = -0.60; SE = 0.26; P = .02) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale II score (beta = -5.19; SE = 2.48; P = .04) at clinical examination. CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study suggests a protective role of lifetime estrogen exposure in PSP. Future studies will be needed to confirm this association.

30611963	2019/5/9	Buprenorphine, Naloxone Drug Combination	Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological	Journal Article	1	0	0	0	0	The effects of buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance treatment on sexual dysfunction, sleep and weight in opioid use disorder patients.	Opioid use disorder is a growing social problem. Different agents are used in the treatment of this disorder. One of these agents is buprenorphine / naloxone combination that includes buprenorphine and naloxone in a ratio of 4:1. Although used successfully in opiate maintenance treatment, buprenorphine / naloxone could have some side effects that might affect the treatment. The present study aimed to examine the effects of buprenorphine /naloxone opiate maintenance treatment on sexual dysfunction, sleep and bodyweight in patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder and to draw the attention of clinicians to the adverse effects of the treatment. The study group included 107 inpatients who were diagnosed based on The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) and received treatment for opioid use disorder. On admission to the hospital and at the end of the 4th month, a Sociodemographic and Clinical Data Form, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Arizona Sexual Life Scale (ASEX) were applied to all patients. Patients were weighed, and their weight was recorded on the day of admission to the hospital and at the end of the 4th month. The data recorded at the beginning and during the treatment of the same group were compared. The mean age of 107 patients was 24.55 +/- 4.27. Overall ASEX scores were 12.98 +/- 4.33 before treatment and 15.03 +/- 6.61 at 4 months (p < 0.001). The mean patient bodyweight was 63.86 +/- 8.78 kg before the treatment and 68.49 +/- 8.65 kg at the 4th month of the treatment (p < 0.001). Total PSQI scores were 8.87 +/- 3.53 before the treatment and 6.85 +/- 3.29 at the 4th month of the treatment (p < 0.001). The study findings demonstrated that after 4 months of buprenorphine /naloxone treatment, total ASEX scores and bodyweight of the patients increased and total PSQI scores decreased. These results demonstrated that sexual problems and bodyweight of the patients increased after the buprenorphine /naloxone treatment and sleep-related problems decreased, albeit still prevalent. These potential side effects should be included with other information about buprenorphine that is given to patients as they may influence interest in starting or continuing treatment.

RATIONALE: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of drugs widely used in the treatment of estrogen sensitive breast and ovarian cancer which convert testosterone to estradiol and androstenedione to estrogen. The AIs of third generation, including anastrazole, letrozole and exemestane, have actually become the standard of care of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer in menopausal women and are recommended as adjuvant treatment after surgery in place of/or following tamoxifen. Their main side-effects include reduction in bone mineral density, occurrence of menopausal manifestations and development of musculoskeletal symptoms which are, usually, transient, but sometimes evolve into a typical form of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, a pathogenic linkage with other autoimmunity diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome (SjS), anti-synthetase antibody syndrome (ASAS), systemic sclerosis (SS) and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), was also described. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we report the first case of a patient with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) developed during treatment with anastrazole. DIAGNOSIS: The patient developed a sudden onset of speech disturbance and disorientation, due to ischemic lesions, after 6 months of AIs therapy and the laboratory examination showed the positivity of anti-Cardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta2 Glycoprotein 1 antibodies and Lupus Anticoagulant, so a certain diagnosis of APS was achieved. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with warfarin associated to hydroxychloroquine and monthly cycles of low doses intravenous immunoglobulins. OUTCOMES: A good control of the disease was obtained despite the continuation of anastrazole; the patient's clinical and laboratory situation remained not modified after AIs withdrawal. LESSONS: We discussed the possible role of anastrazole treatment in inducing APS in our patient, reporting the available literature data about the association between AIs treatment and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, we analyzed the mechanism of action of estrogens in the pathophysiology of autoimmune rheumatic disorders.

A case report and literature review.	Arthralgia, myalgia, paresthesia, reduced bone mineral density, vasomotor side effects including hot flashes and night sweats, genitourinary symptoms including decreased libido, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia are common side effects of aromatase inhibitors. Unlike the common side effects, the information on neurological side effects like hallucination of aromatase inhibitor was limited in literature cases. Herein, we reported a case of hallucination related to anastrozole in a patient with metastatic breast cancer. A 62-year-old female patient with breast cancer developed repetitive hallucinations on the following days of anastrozole initiation. There was no other significant finding in the differential diagnosis of hallucination. Neurological symptoms disappeared after termination of anastrozole. The patient had no neuropsychiatric complaints during letrozole treatment. We aimed to emphasize that neurological side effect like hallucination may rarely occur during the treatment of anastrozole and in case of aromatase inhibitor-related hallucinations, switching to another aromatase inhibitor (letrozole) can be a treatment option.

PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Topiramate (TPM) and lorazepam (LZP) are two examples of frequently prescribed medications that are associated with a high incidence of cognitive impairment; however, the factors that underlie interindividual differences in side effect profiles have not been fully characterized. Our objective was to determine whether working memory capacity (WMC), the amount of information that can be stored and manipulated in memory over short time intervals, is one such factor. METHODS/PROCEDURES: Twenty-nine healthy volunteers completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study during which they received placebo (PBO), TPM, and LZP in random order. Four hours after drug administration, a blood draw was taken to establish drug concentrations, and subjects performed a verbal working memory task while the accuracy and reaction time of their responses were recorded. Working memory capacity was calculated based on accuracy rates during the PBO session, and the role of WMC in moderating the severity of drug-related cognitive impairment was assessed by examining drug-related performance changes from PBO as a function of WMC. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Both TPM and LZP had a negative impact on task performance, although only TPM-related deficits were modulated by WMC; high WMC was associated with more severe impairments and heightened sensitivity to increasing TPM concentrations. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a potential clinical risk factor, high WMC, which is associated with drug-related adverse cognitive events. These data provide objective evidence in support of clinical observations that high-functioning patients are more likely to experience severe cognitive impairments.

BACKGROUND: The combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF pathway inhibitor to treat patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma might increase the clinical benefit of these drugs compared with their use alone. Here, we report preliminary results for the combination of avelumab, an IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the programmed cell death protein ligand PD-L1, and axitinib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor approved for second-line treatment of advanced renal-cell carcinoma, in treatment-naive patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma. METHODS: The JAVELIN Renal 100 study is an ongoing open-label, multicentre, dose-finding, and dose-expansion, phase 1b study, done in 14 centres in the USA, UK, and Japan. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (>/=20 years in Japan) and had histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced renal-cell carcinoma with clear-cell component, life expectancy of at least 3 months, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, received no previous systemic treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma, and had a resected primary tumour. Patients enrolled into the dose-finding phase received 5 mg axitinib orally twice daily for 7 days, followed by combination therapy with 10 mg/kg avelumab intravenously every 2 weeks and 5 mg axitinib orally twice daily. Based on the pharmacokinetic data from the dose-finding phase, ten additional patients were enrolled into the dose-expansion phase and assigned to this regimen. The other patients in the dose-expansion phase started taking combination therapy directly. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities in the first 4 weeks (two cycles) of treatment with avelumab plus axitinib. Safety and antitumour activity analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of avelumab or axitinib. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02493751. FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2015, and Sept 30, 2016, we enrolled six patients into the dose-finding phase and 49 into the dose-expansion phase of the study. One dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 proteinuria due to axitinib was reported among the six patients treated during the dose-finding phase. At the cutoff date (April 13, 2017), six (100%, 95% CI 54-100) of six patients in the dose-finding phase and 26 (53%, 38-68) of 49 patients in the dose-expansion phase had confirmed objective responses (32 [58%, 44-71] of all 55 patients). 32 (58%) of 55 patients had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events, the most frequent being hypertension in 16 (29%) patients and increased concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, amylase, and lipase, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome in four (7%) patients each. Six (11%) of 55 patients died before data cutoff, five (9%) due to disease progression and one (2%) due to treatment-related autoimmune myocarditis. At the end of the dose-finding phase, the maximum tolerated dose established for the combination was avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and axitinib 5 mg twice daily. INTERPRETATION: The safety profile of the combination avelumab plus axitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma seemed to be manageable and consistent with that of each drug alone, and the preliminary data on antitumour activity are encouraging. A phase 3 trial is assessing avelumab and axitinib compared with sunitinib monotherapy. FUNDING: Pfizer and Merck.

This study aims to investigate the contribution of nigral dopaminergic (DA) cell loss, repeated exposure to DA medication and the combination of both to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). A bilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was performed in rats. A set of animals was repeatedly administered with L-dopa (20 mg/kg/day) and benserazide (5 mg/kg/day) over 10 days starting from day 11 post-lesion. Behavioural testing was performed in week 3 post-lesion: novel object recognition (NOR), elevated plus maze (EPM) social interaction (SI) tests, and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AIH). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant partial lesion (48%) in 6-OHDA versus sham rats. This lesion was not associated with motor impairment. However, lesioned rats displayed a significant deficit in the NOR, which was reversed by acute treatment with l-dopa/benserazide (12.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg respectively). Lesioned rats also displayed a deficit in the EPM which was not reversed by acute treatment with l-dopa. No difference was observed in the SI test or in the AIH assay. In all assays, no effect of chronic l-dopa exposure was observed. This study provides new insights into the neuropathophysiology associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD. Our data strongly emphasises a not previously clearly identified critical role in cognition for the SNc. The results suggest that DA pathways were less directly involved in lesion-induced anxiety-like behaviour. We did not report any effect of chronic l-dopa exposure in the context of partial nigral cell loss.

OBJECTIVE: Bone mineral density (BMD) loss, a risk factor for osteoporosis, has been attributed to HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART), including regimens containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. DESIGN: Study 202094 is an open-label, parallel-group, sub-study of the phase III SWORD-1 and SWORD-2 studies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02478632). METHODS: HIV-1-infected adults with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml who received ART containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for at least 6 months were randomized to receive dolutegravir with rilpivirine or continue current ART regimen. Total hip and lumbar spine BMD were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. The primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in total hip BMD. RESULTS: DXA scans were evaluable for 81 participants at baseline and Week 48. Percentage increase in total hip BMD was significantly greater in participants who switched to dolutegravir with rilpivirine (1.34%) compared with participants who continued current ART (0.05%; treatment difference, +1.29%; 95% CI 0.27-2.31; P = 0.014). Lumbar spine BMD significantly increased in the dolutegravir with rilpivirine group by 1.46% (95% CI 0.65-2.28) compared with 0.15% (95% CI -0.79 to 1.09) in the current ART group (treatment difference, 1.32; 95% CI 0.07-2.57; P = 0.039). Participants in the dolutegravir with rilpivirine group experienced significantly greater reductions in bone formation and resorption biomarkers compared with the current ART group. CONCLUSION: Switch to dolutegravir with rilpivirine was associated with significant improvement in BMD and bone turnover markers compared with tenofovir-based three-drug regimens, providing a robust option for preserving bone health while continuing suppressive ART.

Exposure to heavy metals may lead to hearing impairment. However, experimental studies have not explored this issue with and without noise exposure in mature animals with environmentally relevant doses. The aim of this study was to investigate ototoxicity produced by lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) and noise, singly and in combination, in the adult CBA/CaJ mouse. Metals were delivered via drinking water (0.03 mM, 1 mM, and 3 mM Pb; or 30, 100, and 300 muM Cd) for 12 weeks, resulting in environmentally- and occupationally relevant mean (+/- standard deviations) blood levels of Pb (2.89 +/- 0.44, 38.5 +/- 4.9, and 60.1 +/- 6.6 mug/dl, respectively) and Cd (1.3 +/- 0.23, 6.37 +/- 0.87, 27.2 +/- 4.1 mug/L, respectively). Metal treatment was also combined with a noise exposure consisting of a 105 dB broadband (2-20 kHz) stimulus for 2 hr or a sham exposure. Auditory performance was determined by comparing auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) at baseline and after 11 weeks of metal treatment. Metal-exposed animals did not develop significant auditory deficits and did not exhibit morphological damage to cochlear hair cells. In contrast, noise-exposed animals, including those exposed to combinations of metals and noise, demonstrated significant hair cell loss, reduced DPOAE amplitudes, and ABR threshold shifts of 42.2 +/- 13 dB at 32 kHz (105 dB noise alone). No significant potentiation or synergistic effects were found in groups exposed to multiple agents. This study establishes a highly reproducible adult mouse model that may be used to evaluate a variety of environmental exposure mixtures.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinico-radiological entity described by Hinchey et al in late 90's, characterised by variable associations of seizure activity, consciousness impairment ranging from confusion to coma, headaches, visual abnormalities, nausea/vomiting and focal neurological signs. Common causes are accelerated hypertension, eclampsia, preeclampsia, cytotoxic drug use and autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus.We report a case of PRES in a 62-year-old female patient due to hypercalcemia secondary to vitamin D toxicity on treatment with calcium supplements and vitamin D for secondary hypoparathyroidism. She had seizures and visual defects on presentation which recovered completely with treatment of hypercalcemia.

Sertraline (1S,4S-N-methyl-4-[3,4-dichlorophenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthylamine [Zoloft; Pfizer, New York City, NY]) is a frequently used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that has shown efficacy in children, adolescents, and adults. We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with sertraline-induced rhabdomyolysis and renal failure, trismus, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Pharmacogenetic testing later revealed our patient had serotonin transporter polymorphisms and enzymatic alterations that put him at risk for increased levels of sertraline and greater likelihood for untoward side effects.

PURPOSE: Cosmetic vein sclerotherapy is increasingly used to treat varicose veins because of its effectiveness and adherence with British Pharmacopoeia specifications. We present the first documented case of ophthalmic artery occlusion resulting in panocular ischemia secondary to intravascular injection of sodium tetradecyl sulfate sclerosant in a young healthy women seeking treatment for prominent facial veins in her forehead. METHODS: The patient presented with unilateral sudden loss of vision. Funduscopy demonstrated a pale retina, cherry-red spot, and sclerosant visualized directly at the macula. She underwent emergency treatment for central retinal artery occlusion followed by fundal photographs, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: Despite intervention, the vision remained no perception to light. Magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and Doppler ultrasound were unremarkable. The patient later developed neovascular sequelae requiring laser pan-retinal photocoagulation. CONCLUSION: Widely regarded as safe, and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the only published ocular side effects of foam sclerotherapy are transient visual disturbances or temporary scotomas. This case demonstrates irreversible loss of vision as a previously unreported complication. While undoubtedly rare, we believe physicians and surgeons using sclerosant in the orbital adnexa, face, nose, and sinuses should be aware of this sight-threatening complication of injection and counsel potential patients accordingly.

Hyponatremia, as a result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), is well known with the use of nearly all antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. The first symptoms are atypical and are not always mentioned by the patient. However, not recognising the syndrome in due time can be lethal. We describe a 35-year-old woman who died due to lack of recognition of SIADH. The patient, who had a bipolar disorder and was for a long time on a paliperidone depot, developed complaints of nausea, vomiting and thirst after lamotrigine was prescribed. A few days after increasing the dose, she died; no evidence was found of suicide. The SIADH was probably triggered by the use of lamotrigine and paliperidone. Paying sufficient attention to the symptoms that may cause this syndrome, as well as their early recognition, could save lives.

BACKGROUND: Amphotericin-induced phlebitis is a common infusion-related reaction in patients managed for cryptococcal meningitis. High-quality nursing care is critical component to successful cryptococcosis treatment. We highlight the magnitude and main approaches in the management of amphotericin-induced phlebitis and the challenges faced in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We prospectively determined the incidence of amphotericin-induced phlebitis during clinical trials in Kampala, Uganda from 2013 to 2018. We relate practical strategies and challenges faced in clinical management of phlebitis. RESULTS: Overall, 696 participants were diagnosed with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis. Participants received 7-14 doses of intravenous (IV) amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7-1.0 mg/kg/day for induction therapy through peripheral IV lines at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in 5% dextrose. Overall, 18% (125/696) developed amphotericin-induced phlebitis. We used four strategies to minimize/prevent the occurrence of phlebitis. First, after every dose of amphotericin, we gave one liter of intravenous normal saline. Second, we rotated IV catheters every three days. Third, we infused IV amphotericin over 4 h. Finally, early ambulation was encouraged to minimize phlebitis. To alleviate phlebitis symptoms, warm compresses were used. In severe cases, treatment included topical diclofenac gel and oral anti-inflammatory medicines. Antibiotics were used only when definite signs of infection developed. Patient/caregivers' education was vital in implementing these management strategies. Major challenges included implementing these interventions in participants with altered mental status and limited access to topical and oral anti-inflammatory medicines in resource-limited settings. CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin-induced phlebitis is common with amphotericin, yet phlebitis is a preventable complication even in resource-limited settings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The ASTRO-CM trial was registered prospectively. ClincalTrials.gov : NCT01802385 ; Registration date: March 1, 2013; Last verified: February 14, 2018.

Blockade of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) has become one of the most promising immunotherapies for many human cancers. However, immune-related adverse events can be produced by anti-PD-1 therapy. Uveitis is a rare but potentially devastating side effect of anti-PD-1 therapy. Delay in diagnosis or improper treatment may eventually lead to irreversible blindness. Therefore, it is important for the oncologist and the ophthalmologist to recognize and manage this adverse event properly in patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy in a timely manner. Here we present a grade 4 panuveitis with bilateral serous retinal detachment following treatment with nivolumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Oral prednisone, topical steroid eye drops, periorbital injection of steroid and finally intravitreal injection of steroid implant were administered in our patient. We observed that intravitreal injection of dexamethasone implant, but not the periorbital injection of steroid or the steroid eye drops, was effective to control the posterior uveitis and serous retinal detachment. Oral prednisone was also effective, but it might affect the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy and promote tumor growth. We also summarize 15 cases of uveitis reported to date related to nivolumab or pembrolizumab therapy in the present study. The symptoms, signs, potential underlying mechanisms and treatment options regarding this adverse event are discussed.

We present the case of a 60-year-old patient who underwent a complicated cataract surgery with cefuroxime injection (1 mg/0.1 mL) into the anterior chamber at the end of surgery. The patient presented to our hospital due to decrease in visual acuity (VA) after surgery. VA was counting fingers (CF) from 4 meters. There was extensive retinal hemorrhages and edema in addition to retinal vascular leakage detected with fluorescein angiography (FA). After negative microbiologic tests, the patient was treated with intravenous pulse and oral corticosteroids. Rheumatologic investigation was also negative. At month 5, VA was CF from 1 meter in addition to disseminated capillary loss in FA and optic nerve atrophy despite corticosteroid treatment. The patient developed retinal infarction due to cefuroxime injection following a complicated cataract surgery. Surgeons and surgical staff should be aware of the possibility of retinal toxicity while using cefuroxime, particularly in complicated cases.

BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 (NPC1) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterised by progressive neurodegeneration. In preclinical testing, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrins (HPbetaCD) significantly delayed cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, slowed progression of neurological manifestations, and increased lifespan in mouse and cat models of NPC1. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of lumbar intrathecal HPbetaCD. METHODS: In this open-label, dose-escalation phase 1-2a study, we gave monthly intrathecal HPbetaCD to participants with NPC1 with neurological manifestation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA. To explore the potential effect of 2-week dosing, three additional participants were enrolled in a parallel study at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), Chicago, IL, USA. Participants from the NIH were non-randomly, sequentially assigned in cohorts of three to receive monthly initial intrathecal HPbetaCD at doses of 50, 200, 300, or 400 mg per month. A fifth cohort of two participants received initial doses of 900 mg. Participants from RUMC initially received 200 or 400 mg every 2 weeks. The dose was escalated based on tolerance or safety data from higher dose cohorts. Serum and CSF 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24[S]-HC), which serves as a biomarker of target engagement, and CSF protein biomarkers were evaluated. NPC Neurological Severity Scores (NNSS) were used to compare disease progression in HPbetaCD-treated participants relative to a historical comparison cohort of 21 NPC1 participants of similar age range. FINDINGS: Between Sept 21, 2013, and Jan 19, 2015, 32 participants with NPC1 were assessed for eligibility at the National Institutes of Health. 18 patients were excluded due to inclusion criteria not met (six patients), declined to participate (three patients), pursued independent expanded access and obtained the drug outside of the study (three patients), enrolled in the RUMC cohort (one patient), or too late for the trial enrolment (five patients). 14 patients were enrolled and sequentially assigned to receive intrathecal HPbetaCD at a starting dose of 50 mg per month (three patients), 200 mg per month (three patients), 300 mg per month (three patients), 400 mg per month (three patients), or 900 mg per month (two patients). During the first year, two patients had treatment interrupted for one dose, based on grade 1 ototoxicity. All 14 patients were assessed at 12 months. Between 12 and 18 months, one participant had treatment interrupted at 17 months due to hepatocellular carcinoma, one patient had dose interruption for 2 doses based on caregiver hardship and one patient had treatment interrupted for 1 dose for mastoiditis. 11 patients were assessed at 18 months. Between Dec 11, 2013, and June 25, 2014, three participants were assessed for eligibility and enrolled at RUMC, and were assigned to receive intrathecal HPbetaCD at a starting dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks (two patients), or 400 mg every two weeks (one patient). There were no dropouts in this group and all 3 patients were assessed at 18 months. Biomarker studies were consistent with improved neuronal cholesterol homoeostasis and decreased neuronal pathology. Post-drug plasma 24(S)-HC area under the curve (AUC(8-72)) values, an indicator of neuronal cholesterol homoeostasis, were significantly higher than post-saline plasma 24(S)-HC AUC(8-72) after doses of 900 mg (p=0.0063) and 1200 mg (p=0.0037). CSF 24(S)-HC concentrations in three participants given either 600 or 900 mg of HPbetaCD were increased about two fold (p=0.0032) after drug administration. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. Mid-frequency to high-frequency hearing loss, an expected adverse event, was documented in all participants. When managed with hearing aids, this did not have an appreciable effect on daily communication. The NNSS for the 14 participants treated monthly increased at a rate of 1.22, SEM 0.34 points per year compared with 2.92, SEM 0.27 points per year (p=0.0002) for the 21 patient comparison group. Decreased progression was observed for NNSS domains of ambulation (p=0.0622), cognition (p=0.0040) and speech (p=0.0423). INTERPRETATION: Patients with NPC1 treated with intrathecal HPbetaCD had slowed disease progression with an acceptable safety profile. These data support the initiation of a multinational, randomised, controlled trial of intrathecal HPbetaCD.

BACKGROUND: Panitumumab is the first human combinatorial antibody for the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Dermatologic toxicity of all grades occurs in more than 90% of patients. However, there are few reports of purpura induced by anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody. Renal failure is also uncommon as an adverse event of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old Japanese man with advanced colon cancer received monotherapy with panitumumab. General malaise, bilateral edema of his legs, and bilateral purpura of his forearms developed 2 days after the second cycle of panitumumab. A skin biopsy was performed to evaluate the purpuric lesions on his left leg and leukocytoclastic vasculitis was diagnosed. Blood tests showed grade III acute renal failure with a blood urea nitrogen level of 33.8 mg/dL and a creatinine level of 3.10 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of leukocytoclastic vasculitis followed by purpura and acute renal failure associated with panitumumab.

There is little information about cardiovascular adverse event (CV-AE) incidence in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with bosutinib in the real-life practice. We identified 54 consecutive CML patients treated with bosutinib, stratified according to the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) assessment, based on sex, age, smoking habits, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol levels. The 40-month cumulative incidence of CV-AEs was 25.2 +/- 8.1%. Patients with the SCORE of high-very high showed a significantly higher incidence of CV-AEs (55 +/- 12.9% vs 9 +/- 9.5%; p = 0.002). Overall, 9 CV-AEs were reported, with 2 deaths attributed to CV-AE. In conclusion, the SCORE assessment before starting treatment is helpful in identifying CV-AE high-risk patients during bosutinib treatment.

29549244	2019/3/16	Sildenafil Citrate	Glucose Intolerance	Journal Article_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	0	1	0	1	0	Effects of sildenafil treatment on thermogenesis and glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obese mice.	Stimulation of thermogenic pathways appears to be a promising approach to find new ways of tackling metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Thermogenic, weight reducing and insulin sensitizing effects of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors have recently been postulated, suggesting that modulators of endogenous cGMP signaling have the therapeutic potential to treat metabolic disorders. However, most studies have been performed in vitro or in animals that were not glucose intolerant. We, thus, aimed to test the metabolic effects of the PDE 5 inhibitor sildenafil by treating diet-induced obese (DIO) mice orally for 8 days. Surprisingly, our results revealed no changes in body temperature, brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and gene expression in BAT and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), thus excluding a thermogenic or 'browning' effect of sildenafil in preexisting obesity. In contrast, sildenafil-treated DIO mice displayed changes in liver metabolism and glucose homeostasis resulting in impaired glucose tolerance (P < 0.05), demonstrating for the first time an unfavorable metabolic effect of increased hepatic cGMP signaling in obesity. As sildenafil is commonly prescribed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension and erectile dysfunction in diabetic and/or obese patients, follow up studies are urgently required to re-evaluate the drug safety.

BACKGROUND: Progestin-only subdermal implants are one of the most effective contraceptive methods. Anembryonic pregnancy is not reported as a possible outcome in cases of contraceptive failure of these products. We present a rare case of anembryonic pregnancy occurring in a woman with levonorgestrel-releasing implant (JADELLE(R)). CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old Cameroonian (black African) housewife with a JADELLE(R) implant for 13 months, consulted at our hospital for a 1-month history of pelvic pain, prolonged menstrual bleeding, and spotting. She had a last normal menstrual period 8 weeks 1 day prior to presentation. On examination, there was suprapubic tenderness and blood trickling from her cervix. Despite a negative qualitative urine pregnancy test, an empty intrauterine gestational sac with mean sac diameter of 28 mm was visualized on pelvic ultrasound. Dilation and curettage with suction was done and she had complete relief from symptoms. CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the possibility of anembryonic pregnancy occurring in women using the levonorgestrel-releasing subdermal implant (JADELLE(R)).

Lipid-lowering agent-triggered dermatomyositis (DM) or polymyositis (PM) is a rare event. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to describe a series of such cases. A retrospective cohort study of 5 DM and 4 PM cases triggered by prior exposure to lipid-lowering agents between 2001 and 2017 was carried out. All patients, except for two cases, had muscle biopsy compatible with inflammatory myopathy and no serum autoantibodies positive for anti-SRP or anti-HMGCoAR. Median age of the patients at time of diagnosis was 68 years. Seven patients had previously taken simvastatin 20 mg/day (exposure period from 2 days to 4 years) and two bezafibrate 100 mg/day (3-4 months). Median time from symptom onset to disease diagnosis was 6 months. All patients with DM had a heliotrope and/or Gottron's papules. All patients had symmetrical, predominantly proximal muscle weakness of limbs, with median serum creatine phosphokinase of 3087U/L (interquartile 25-75% range 1293-13,937 U/L). All patients received glucocorticoid and immunosuppressants. Complete reversal of clinical symptoms and normalization of serum creatine phosphokinase level occurred within a median of 12 months after starting the treatment. There was disease relapse in three cases, and one case of death was unrelated to the disease (pulmonary infectious complications resulting from lymphoma). In contrast to cases described in the literature, the patients in the present study had a relatively more aggressive course, requiring glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants, in addition to a tendency for a longer period to achieve disease remission.

This study aimed to investigate the association of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events of cinacalcet with gallstones in the hemodialysis (HD) patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). A total of 23 HD patients under the treatment with cinacalcet and 101 control patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. We investigated the prevalence of gallstones and the association of GI adverse events of cinacalcet with gallstones. The prevalence of gallstones was significantly higher in the HD patients with cinacalcet compared with the controls (47.8% vs. 15.8%). The longer time on HD, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and elevated parathyroid hormone level were observed in the HD patients with cinacalcet. Besides, GI adverse events of cinacalcet were observed more frequently in the HD patients with gallstones compared with those without gallstones (odds ratio 13.5, 95% CI: 1.80-101). Therefore, screening for gallstones before dosing cinacalcet may reduce the risk of GI adverse events in SHPT patients.

30167757	2019/3/9	Voriconazole	Dizziness	Journal Article_and_Randomized Controlled Trial	1	0	0	0	0	Voriconazole greatly increases the exposure to oral buprenorphine.	PURPOSE: Buprenorphine has low oral bioavailability. Regardless of sublingual administration, a notable part of buprenorphine is exposed to extensive first-pass metabolism by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. As drug interaction studies with buprenorphine are limited, we wanted to investigate the effect of voriconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral buprenorphine. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers were given either placebo or voriconazole (orally, 400 mg twice on day 1 and 200 mg twice on days 2-5) for 5 days in a randomized, cross-over study. On day 5, they ingested 0.2 mg (3.6 mg during placebo phase) oral buprenorphine. We measured plasma and urine concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine and monitored their pharmacological effects. Pharmacokinetic parameters were normalized for a buprenorphine dose of 1.0 mg. RESULTS: Voriconazole greatly increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-18)) of buprenorphine (4.3-fold, P < 0.001), its peak concentration (C(max)) (3.9-fold), half-life (P < 0.05), and excretion into urine (A(e); P < 0.001). Voriconazole also markedly enhanced the C(max) (P < 0.001), AUC(0-18) (P < 0.001), and A(e) (P < 0.05) of unconjugated norbuprenorphine but decreased its renal clearance (P < 0.001). Mild dizziness and nausea occurred during both study phases. CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole greatly increases exposure to oral buprenorphine, mainly by inhibiting intestinal and liver CYP3A4. Effect on some transporters may explain elevated norbuprenorphine concentrations. Although oral buprenorphine is not commonly used, this interaction may become relevant in patients receiving sublingual buprenorphine together with voriconazole or other CYP3A4 or transporter inhibitors.
30024398	2018/11/7	Clomiphene	ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	1	0	Acute myocardial infarction associated with clomiphene citrate in a young woman.	Clomiphene citrate is a drug that stimulates ovulation and is commonly used in cases of female infertility. Generally, it is recognized as a safe agent for ovulation induction, but rarely, it is associated with life-threatening conditions. A 36-year-old woman who had been prescribed clomiphene citrate for infertility was admitted to the emergency department for chest pain lasting for 2 hours. She had no history of smoking, and she did not have any cardiac risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI). An electrocardiogram performed on admission revealed ST-elevation in the precordial leads. She was taken to the catheter laboratory for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and the coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the midportion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with a heavy thrombus burden. The circumflex and right coronary arteries were normal. After balloon dilatation, a 2.75x15-mm drug eluting stent was implanted in the mid part of the LAD. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery. Before discharge, echocardiography revealed apical akinesis; anterior and lateral hypokinesis; and an ejection fraction of 45% with mild mitral regurgitation. Although clomiphene citrate is a relatively safe drug for ovarian stimulation, it has been associated with serious side effects, such as MI. Physicians should be aware of the potential risks of clomiphene citrate, especially in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease.

Older patients with type 2 diabetes are prone to developing adverse events with aggressive antihyperglycaemic therapy. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is one such rare, life-threatening adverse drug effect. We report the case of a 70-year-old man with a glycated haemoglobin of 7.9% who was on a stable, maximally tolerated dose of metformin for managing his type 2 diabetes. He was initiated on liraglutide injections with hopes to achieve better glycaemic control, but developed unrelenting nausea and vomiting during the third week of treatment. He presented to the hospital with these symptoms and was noted to have severe MALA. He sustained an in-hospital cardiac arrest requiring emergent resuscitation along with vasopressor and mechanical ventilator support. He underwent continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration to remove metformin and correct the acidosis, following which he stabilised and supportive therapy was weaned off. He was discharged from the hospital on insulin therapy with incomplete renal recovery.

PURPOSE: Body composition parameters including low muscle mass, muscle attenuation (which reflects muscle quality) and adipose tissue measurements have emerged as prognostic factors in cancer patients. However, knowledge regarding the possibility of excessive muscle loss during specific systemic therapies is unknown. We describe the changes in body composition and muscle attenuation (MA) during taxane- and anthracycline-based regimens and its association with overall survival (OS) in metastatic breast cancer patients. METHODS: The lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI) was used as marker of muscle mass. LSMI, MA, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) were measured before and after first-line treatment with paclitaxel (n = 73) or 5-fluorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide (FAC) (n = 25) using CT-images. Determinants of the change of LSMI and MA were analyzed using multiple linear regression. OS was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: MA significantly decreased during paclitaxel treatment (- 0.9 HU, p = 0.03). LSMI (p = 0.40), SAT (p = 0.75), VAT (p = 0.84) and IMAT (p = 0.10) remained stable. No significant alterations in body composition parameters during FAC-treatment were observed. Previous (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy contributed to larger loss of MA during the current treatment. Body composition changes during chemotherapy were not associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: MA decreased during treatment with paclitaxel, while muscle mass was stable. Body composition changes are not associated with survival in the absence of progressive disease.

Src family kinases (SFKs) are hyperactivated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SFKs impede the retinoic acid receptor, and SFK inhibitors enhance all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated cellular differentiation in AML cell lines and primary blasts. To translate these findings into the clinic, we undertook a phase-I dose-escalation study of the combination of the SFK inhibitor dasatinib and ATRA in patients with high-risk myeloid neoplasms. Nine subjects were enrolled: six received 70 mg dasatinib plus 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily, and three received 100 mg dasatinib plus 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily for 28 days. Headache and QTc prolongations were the only two grade 3 adverse events observed. No significant clinical responses were observed. We conclude that the combination of 70 mg dasatinib and 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily is safe with acceptable toxicity. Our results provide the safety profile for further investigations into the clinical efficacy of this combination therapy in myeloid malignancies.

Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy often experience taste and smell abnormalities (TSA). To date, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this frequent side-effect have not been determined and effective treatments are not available. This study assessed the feasibility of lactoferrin (LF) supplementation as a treatment for TSA and investigate the related mechanisms through salivary proteome analysis. Nineteen cancer patients with established TSA following chemotherapy administration were enrolled in this study. Cancer patients and additional 12 healthy subjects took LF supplements, 3 tablets per day (250 mg per tablet), for 30 days. Saliva was collected at three timepoints: baseline, 30-day LF supplementation, and 30-day post-LF supplementation. Patient's TSA level, salivary proteome, and salivary minerals at each LF treatment stage were analyzed. High TSA level was associated with high concentration of salivary Fe and loss of critical salivary immune proteins. LF supplementation significantly decreased the concentration of salivary Fe (P = 0.025), increased the abundance (P < 0.05) of salivary alpha-amylase and Zn-alpha-2-GP, and led to an overall increase of expression (>/=2-fold changes) of immune proteins including immunoglobulin heavy chain, annexin A1, and proteinase inhibitor. Abundance of alpha-amylase and SPLUNC2 were further increased (P < 0.05) at 30-day post-LF supplementation in cancer patients. At the same time, total TSA score was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) in chemotherapy patients. This study demonstrated the feasibility of developing lactoferrin supplementation as a treatment to reduce TSA caused by chemotherapy and improve cancer patient's oral immunity.

29500139	2019/3/6	Dronedarone	Peripheral Nervous System Diseases	Comparative Study_and_Journal Article	1	0	0	0	0	Assessing the Risk for Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients Treated With Dronedarone Compared With That in Other Antiarrhythmics.	PURPOSE: There are few data on the risk for peripheral neuropathy associated with dronedarone, a newer antiarrhythmic medicine. The objective of this study was to assess whether dronedarone is potentially associated with an increased risk for peripheral neuropathy compared with other antiarrhythmics, including amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone. METHODS: The MarketScan database was used for identifying patients who were at least 18 years of age, had atrial fibrillation or flutter, and had not been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in the 180-day period prior to or on the date of the first prescription of an antiarrhythmic between July 20, 2009, and December 31, 2011. Peripheral neuropathy that occurred during the treatment period for a study drug was ascertained using ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. For each antiarrhythmic, the incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy was calculated. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for peripheral neuropathy for dronedarone compared with another antiarrhythmic was obtained, with control for age, sex, diabetes mellitus status, and the presence of other comorbidities. FINDINGS: The study population included 106,933 patients treated with dronedarone (n = 12,989), amiodarone (n = 45,173), sotalol (n = 22,036), flecainide (n = 14,244), or propafenone (n = 12,491). The incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) of peripheral neuropathy were 1.33 for dronedarone, 2.38 for amiodarone, 1.20 for sotalol, 1.08 for flecainide, and 1.97 for propafenone. The aHRs for peripheral neuropathy for dronedarone relative to other drugs ranged from 0.53 (95% CI, 0.21-1.34) compared with propafenone, to 0.94 (95% CI, 0.38-2.30) compared with sotalol. A new-user analysis showed similar results. IMPLICATIONS: The risks for peripheral neuropathy were not significantly different between dronedarone and other antiarrhythmics.

PURPOSE: There are few data on the risk for peripheral neuropathy associated with dronedarone, a newer antiarrhythmic medicine. The objective of this study was to assess whether dronedarone is potentially associated with an increased risk for peripheral neuropathy compared with other antiarrhythmics, including amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone. METHODS: The MarketScan database was used for identifying patients who were at least 18 years of age, had atrial fibrillation or flutter, and had not been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in the 180-day period prior to or on the date of the first prescription of an antiarrhythmic between July 20, 2009, and December 31, 2011. Peripheral neuropathy that occurred during the treatment period for a study drug was ascertained using ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. For each antiarrhythmic, the incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy was calculated. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for peripheral neuropathy for dronedarone compared with another antiarrhythmic was obtained, with control for age, sex, diabetes mellitus status, and the presence of other comorbidities. FINDINGS: The study population included 106,933 patients treated with dronedarone (n = 12,989), amiodarone (n = 45,173), sotalol (n = 22,036), flecainide (n = 14,244), or propafenone (n = 12,491). The incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) of peripheral neuropathy were 1.33 for dronedarone, 2.38 for amiodarone, 1.20 for sotalol, 1.08 for flecainide, and 1.97 for propafenone. The aHRs for peripheral neuropathy for dronedarone relative to other drugs ranged from 0.53 (95% CI, 0.21-1.34) compared with propafenone, to 0.94 (95% CI, 0.38-2.30) compared with sotalol. A new-user analysis showed similar results. IMPLICATIONS: The risks for peripheral neuropathy were not significantly different between dronedarone and other antiarrhythmics.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Bortezomib (BTZ) is largely used as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of multiple myeloma. However, one of the significant limiting complications of BTZ is painful peripheral neuropathy during BTZ therapy. The purpose of this study was to examine the underlying mechanisms leading to neuropathic pain induced by BTZ. METHODS: ELISA and western blot analysis were used to examine the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and its receptor, transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and intracellular p38-MAPK and JNK signal in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion. Behavioral test was performed to determine mechanical pain and cold sensitivity in a rat model. RESULTS: Systemic injection of BTZ significantly increased mechanical pain and cold sensitivity as compared with control animals (P< 0.05 vs. control rats). Our data also showed that protein expression of TRPA1 was upregulated in the dorsal root ganglion of BTZ rats and blocking TRPA1 attenuated mechanical pain and cold sensitivity in control rats and BTZ rats (P< 0.05 vs. vehicle control). Notably, the inhibitory effect of blocking TRPA1 on mechanical pain and cold sensitivity was smaller in BTZ rats than that in control rats. In addition, a blockade of TNF-alpha attenuated intracellular p38-MAPK and JNK signal in the dorsal root ganglion. This also decreased TRPA1 expression and alleviated mechanical hyperalgesia and cold hypersensitivity in BTZ rats. CONCLUSION: We revealed specific signaling pathways leading to neuropathic pain induced by chemotherapeutic BTZ. The data also suggest that blocking TRPA1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha is beneficial to alleviate neuropathic pain during BTZ intervention.
30624504	2019/2/8	Sorafenib (mulitikinase inhibitor)	Oophoritis	Journal Article	1	0	0	1	0	Rare complications of multikinase inhibitor treatment.	OBJECTIVE: The advent of multikinase inhibitor (MKI) therapy has led to a radical change in the treatment of patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma. The aim of this manuscript is to communicate rare adverse events that occurred in less than 5% of patients in clinical trials in a subset of patients treated in our hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Out of 760 patients with thyroid cancer followed up with in our Division of Endocrinology, 29 (3.8%) received treatment with MKIs. The median age at diagnosis of these patients was 53 years (range 20-70), and 75.9% of them were women. Sorafenib was prescribed as first-line treatment to 23 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and as second-line treatment to one patient with advanced medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Vandetanib was indicated as first-line treatment in 6 patients with MTC and lenvatinib as second-line treatment in two patients with progressive disease under sorafenib treatment. RESULTS: During the follow-up of treatment (mean 13.7 +/- 7 months, median 12 months, range 6-32), 5/29 (17.2%) patients presented rare adverse events. These rare adverse effects were: heart failure, thrombocytopenia, and squamous cell carcinoma during sorafenib therapy and squamous cell carcinoma and oophoritis with intestinal perforation during vandetanib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: About 3 to 5 years after the approval of MKI therapy, we learned that MKIs usually lead to adverse effects in the majority of patients. Although most of them are manageable, we still need to be aware of potentially serious and rare or unreported adverse effects that can be life-threatening.
29747963	2019/1/25	Menotropins	Earache	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	The possible effect of human menopausal gonadotropin on the audio-vestibular system.	OBJECTIVE: Human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) is one of the commonest drugs used for ovarian stimulation with no reports on the audio-vestibular system. This study aims to examine HMG on the hearing profile of patients planning intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). METHODS: This prospective study was conducted from June 2016 to June 2017 in a tertiary referral hospital. The audio-vestibular system of a total of 30 patients was evaluated using pure tone audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs in the form of a DP-gram) and Vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) immediately before therapy and at the day 10 after therapy. Audio-vestibular adverse effects including hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and otalgia were also considered. RESULTS: Significant elevations in hearing thresholds were found on comparing thresholds at the day 10 at the onset of the study. The elevations were mostly at frequencies (1000, 2000 and 8000Hz) and did not affect speech perception. For DPOAE, significant differences were observed at all F2 frequencies on comparing both amplitudes and signal to noise ratios. Otologic complaints were significant for tinnitus and hearing loss. CONCLUSION: Significant auditory and vestibular adverse effects may result from HMG therapy, indicating the importance of prompt monitoring of auditory functions in these patients.

INTRODUCTION: Tapentadol is a centrally acting analgesic that has been available for the management of acute and chronic pain in routine clinical practice since 2009. METHODS: This is the first integrated descriptive analysis of post-marketing safety data following the use of tapentadol in a broad range of pain conditions relating to the topics overall safety, dose administration above approved dosages, administration during pregnancy, serotonin syndrome, respiratory depression, and convulsion. The data analyzed pertain to spontaneous reports from healthcare and non-healthcare professionals and were put in the context of safety information known from interventional and non-interventional trials. RESULTS: The first years of routine clinical practice experience with tapentadol have confirmed the tolerability profile that emerged from the clinical trials. Moreover, the reporting of expected side effects such as respiratory depression and convulsion was low and no major risks were identified. The evaluation of available post-marketing data did not confirm the theoretical risk of serotonin syndrome nor did it reveal unexpected side effects with administration of higher than recommended doses. CONCLUSION: More than 8 years after its first introduction, the favorable overall safety profile of tapentadol in the treatment of various pain conditions is maintained in the general population.

Currently, levamisole is the most common cocaine adulterant worldwide and it is known to induce a variety of adverse side effects. Animal studies and human case reports suggest potential neurotoxicity of the compound but neither neuroanatomical nor cognitive effects of levamisole have been systematically investigated in cocaine users so far. We examined cognitive performance and cortical structural differences between chronic cocaine users with low and high recent exposure to levamisole objectively determined by quantitative toxicological hair analyses. In Study 1, we compared 26 chronic cocaine users with low levamisole exposure (lowLevCU), 49 matched cocaine users with high levamisole exposure (highLevCU), and 78 matched stimulant-naive controls regarding cognitive functioning employing a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. In Study 2, we investigated cortical thickness by use of T1-weighted MRI in a subgroup of 12 lowLevCU, 17 highLevCU, and 38 stimulant-naive controls. In Study 1, both cocaine user groups showed significant impairments in the cognitive domains of attention and working memory as well as in the global cognitive index. However, highLevCU showed significantly worse executive functions compared to lowLevCU although both groups did not differ in severity of cocaine consumption and other clinical dimensions. Study 2 revealed that highLevCU, displayed reduced cortical thickness specifically in the middle frontal gyrus compared to both controls and lowLevCU. Our results suggest that levamisole exposure during the last months in cocaine users is associated with increased executive function impairments and pronounced thinning of the lateral prefrontal cortex. Consequently, prevention and drug policy-making should aim to reduce levamisole contamination of street cocaine.

Since a few weeks, he received a treatment with a combination of tricyclic antidepressants for mood disorder. The clinical picture mimicked Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), but we could rule out this diagnosis by means of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which showed normal level of tau protein and Abeta(1-42), being also negative for CSF 14-3-3 protein. A complete clinical recovery was observed after the discontinuation of antidepressants. So far, some cases of drug-induced CJD-like syndrome have been described. In our experience, early CSF analysis shows high diagnostic usefulness in order to exclude CJD.

Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are novel monoclonal antibodies that have recently been used successfully for treatment of metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab is a human monoclonal antibody against Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4) receptor, which suppresses T-cell proliferation and stimulates an inflammatory response against cancer cells. Nivolumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody against the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated programmed death 1 receptor (PD-1). Ipilimumab and Nivolumab combination treatment has been shown to induce remission and prolong survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. The side effect profile of these medications has not been well studied. One entity of the side effects reported in the literature is immune-related adverse events (irAEs). There have been few case reports where these events were serious and irreversible. In this case report, we describe a fatal and severe diffuse panmyositis that involved the cardiac, respiratory, and extraocular muscles in a patient with metastatic melanoma secondary to combination treatment with Ipilimumab/Nivolumab.
29537058	2018/12/29	Lacosamide	Bradycardia	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	[Lacosamide associated with high-degree block in a patient with trigeminal neuralgia].	INTRODUCTION: Lacosamide is an antiepileptic drug whose exact mechanism of action remains unknown. It acts by increasing the slow inactivation of the voltage-dependent sodium channels of the cell membranes. It is indicated in the treatment of focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation and is occasionally used as adjunct treatment in neuropathic pain. Although the most frequent side effects are mild (dizziness, diplopia, blurred vision, headache, tremor, etc.), others such as supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, changes in repolarisation, atrioventricular blocks and even cardiac arrest or sudden death have been reported. CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old male, diagnosed with classic trigeminal neuralgia treated with 200 mg/12 h of carbamazepine, who visited due to a worsening of the pain in the trigeminal V1-V2 region. On the sixth day after admission, after adjusting the carbamazepine treatment to a descending regime, 400 mg/24 h of eslicarbazepine and 100 mg/12 h of intravenous lacosamide, he presented a complete atrioventricular block with extreme bradycardia that required the placement of a pacemaker. CONCLUSIONS: Voltage-dependent sodium channel blockade mainly affects non-sinusal cardiac tissue. An alteration in the atrioventricular or infrahisian node is more consistent with its mechanism of action. Other cases of atrioventricular block in this kind of polytherapy have been reported. Precaution is advised in the concomitant use of antiepileptic drugs, above all among those that prolong the PR interval, and they should be contraindicated in patients with a history of atrioventricular block, ischaemic heart disease or heart failure. Before starting, a baseline electrocardiogram and regular electrocardiographic monitoring are advised during the first few weeks.

31177518	2019/6/18	Nitrogen	Cognitive Dysfunction	Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	Early detection of diving-related cognitive impairment of different nitrogen-oxygen gas mixtures using critical flicker fusion frequency.	INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment related to inert gas narcosis (IGN) is a threat to diving safety and operations at depth that might be reduced by using enriched air nitrox (EANx) mixtures. Using critical flicker fusion frequency (CFFF), a possible early detection of cognitive abilities/cerebral arousal impairment when breathing different oxygen (O2) fractions was investigated. METHODS: Eight male volunteers performed, in random order, two dry chamber dives breathing either air or EANx40 (40% O(2)-60% nitrogen) for 20 minutes (min) at 0.4 MPa. Cognition and arousal were assessed before the dive; upon arrival at 0.4 MPa; after 15 min exposure at 0.4 MPa; on surfacing and 30 min post-dive using behavioural computer-based testing psychology experiment building language (PEBL) and by CFFF while continuously recording brain oxygenation with near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: In both breathing conditions, CFFF and PEBL demonstrated a significant inverse correlation (Pearson r of -0.90, P < 0.0001), improved cognitive abilities/cerebral arousal occurred upon arrival at 0.4 MPa followed by a progressive deterioration. Initial brain activation was associated with a significant increase in oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2) and a simultaneous decrease of deoxyhaemoglobin (HHb). The magnitude of the changes was significantly greater under EANx (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Since changes were not related to haemodynamic variables, HbO(2) and HHb values indicate a significant, O(2)-dependent activation in the prefrontal cortex. Owing to the correlation with some tests from the PEBL, CFFF could be a convenient measure of cognitive performance/ability in extreme environments, likely under the direct influence of oxygen partial pressure, a potent modulator of IGN symptoms.

Nalmefene, an opioid antagonist, has recently been approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence. We describe here the first case of a 52-year-old woman who developed a severe central sleep apnoea (CSA) 5 months after initiation of nalmefene. Scoring of ventilation during sleep recording revealed an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 67/h with 98.7% of central events and an apnoea index of 65/h. Nalmefene was withdrawn and a new polysomnography was performed which concluded that CSA has disappeared. Pathophysiology is still unclear but could involve the kappa-opioid receptors. Physicians should be aware that CSA might affect patients treated with nalmefene. Further investigations are required to determine the pathophysiology, frequency, and treatment of CSA associated with nalmefene and other therapy for alcohol disorders.

Trifluridine/tipiracil has been approved for the treatment of refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Adverse effects of this drug combination include leukopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea, and vomiting. We present a case of trifluridine/tipiracil-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) with late-onset Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) in a 42-year-old man with metastatic appendiceal cancer. The patient's biopsy-proven LCV developed one month after he began trifluridine/tipiracil treatment and resolved after discontinuation of the drug. He presented to the emergency department two months after the appearance of his LCV with shortness of breath, elevated blood pressure, elevated creatinine, hematuria, and proteinuria. A kidney biopsy was performed and the presence of IgA deposits and cellular crescents indicated rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis secondary to Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP). Neither LCV nor HSP have been reported as adverse effects of trifluridine/tipiracil treatment. Malignancy as a cause of our patient's HSP is another possibility. The delay between our patient's skin findings and acute renal failure indicates that suspected HSP should be monitored by urinalysis for a period of time owing to the risk of life-threatening renal disease.

SCOPE: Flaxseed oil is a rich source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is the precursor of the long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). This study investigates the protective effect of flaxseed oil against intestinal injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). MATERIALS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four weaned pigs were used in a 2 x 2 factorial experiment with dietary treatment (5% corn oil vs 5% flaxseed oil) and LPS challenge (saline vs LPS). On day 21 of the experiment, pigs were administrated with LPS or saline. At 2 h and 4 h post-administration, blood samples were collected. After the blood harvest at 4 h, all piglets were slaughtered and intestinal samples were collected. Flaxseed oil supplementation led to the enrichment of ALA, EPA, and total n-3 PUFAs in intestine. Flaxseed oil improved intestinal morphology, jejunal lactase activity, and claudin-1 protein expression. Flaxseed oil downregulated the mRNA expression of intestinal necroptotic signals. Flaxseed oil also downregulated the mRNA expression of intestinal toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4) and its downstream signals myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins 1, 2 (NOD1, NOD2) and its adapter molecule, receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that dietary addition of flaxseed oil enhances intestinal integrity and barrier function, which is involved in modulating necroptosis and TLR4/NOD signaling pathways.

INTRODUCTION: The optimal concentration for the use of endodontic topical antibiotics is not known. The aims of this study were to determine the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, minocycline, Augmentin (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), and tigecycline against common endodontic pathogens and to evaluate ex vivo the antibacterial efficacy and discoloration effect of triple antibiotic paste (TAP), Augmentin, and tigecycline at different concentrations using a slow-release hydrogel scaffold. METHODS: Using the Epsilometer test method (Etest; bioMerieux USA, St Louis, MO), MICs and MBCs of selected antibiotics were determined against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus intermedius, and Enterococcus faecalis. Biofilms of these bacterial species were then grown in extracted single-rooted teeth anaerobically for 3 weeks. Root canals were filled with TAP, Augmentin, and tigecycline at concentrations of 1 or 0.1 mg/mL in a degradable hydrogel scaffold or pure TAP at 1 g/mL for 7 days. Coronal discoloration was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after dressing. RESULTS: MIC/MBC data showed significant efficacy of tigecycline, Augmentin, and minocycline compared with the other antibiotics (P < .05). Significant differences were found when comparing the log10 colony-forming units of all experimental groups (P < .05). TAP at 1 g/mL had no bacterial growth but caused the greatest discoloration. Hydrogel mixtures with TAP, Augmentin, or tigecycline at 1 mg/mL significantly reduced bacterial growth and the number of positive samples compared with those at 0.1 mg/mL (P < .05) with minimal discoloration. CONCLUSIONS: TAP, Augmentin, and tigecycline in a hydrogel at 1 mg/mL reduced bacterial growth significantly with minimal color change.
28791627	2019/4/4	Benperidol	Long QT Syndrome	Comparative Study_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Influence of intravenous administration of the antipsychotic drug benperidol on the QT interval.	A group effect is generally assumed regarding the prolongation of the QT interval through butyrophenone antipsychotics like haloperidol. Consequently intravenous administration of benperidol is seen critically notwithstanding sparse evidence; thus benperidol and haloperidol were compared regarding their cardiac risk of prolonging the QT interval when administered intravenously for acute sedation of psychotic patients. The QT interval was measured by a 12-lead ECG. For the correction of QT values Bazett's formula was used. The resulting QTc intervals of the benperidol and the haloperidol group were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test. Our data provide statistical evidence for benperidol being less prone to cause QTc prolongation than haloperidol (p = 0.049). The results of our study indicate a more favourable risk profile of benperidol compared to haloperidol regarding QTc prolongation when administered intravenously.

BACKGROUND: Dutasteride is a potent inhibitor of 5-alpha reductase enzymes that reduces concentrations of dihydrotestosterone to a greater extent than finasteride. Whether this has adverse implications for bone health is unknown. We compared the risk of osteoporosis and fractures in older men treated with dutasteride or finasteride. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study with high-dimensional propensity score matching of Ontario men aged 66 years or older who started treatment with dutasteride or finasteride between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2012. The primary outcome was a diagnosis of osteoporosis within 2 years of treatment initiation. A secondary outcome was osteoporotic or fragility fractures. RESULTS: We studied 31,615 men treated with dutasteride and an equal number of men treated with finasteride. Dutasteride-treated patients had a lower incidence of osteoporosis than those receiving finasteride [2.2 versus 2.6 per 100 person years; hazard ratio (HR) 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.93]. This effect was no longer statistically significant following adjustment for specialty of prescribing physician (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02)]. There was no differential risk of fractures with dutasteride (HR 1.04; 95% 0.86 to 1.25). CONCLUSIONS: Despite differential effects on 5-alpha reductase, dutasteride is not associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis or fractures in older men relative to finasteride. These findings suggest that dutasteride does not adversely affect bone health.

The consumption of daily nutritional supplements has risen dramatically all over the world. Many people believe that dietary supplements, if not useful, are at least safe to fulfil small dietary gaps. Many nutritional supplements have not been approved by Federal Drug Administration due to their unregulated active ingredients, but they are available as over the counter. One of the active ingredients, exogenous triiodothyronine (T3), has been reported in dietary supplements. We present a case of sudden onset of tetraparesis. Laboratory workup showed hypokalaemia, low thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine (T4) but normal T3 and thyroglobulin levels. The radioiodine uptake scan also showed reduced uptake. After aggressive serum potassium correction and stopping supplements, his condition got improved. So the suspicion of exogenous T3-induced thyrotoxic periodic paralysis was confirmed.

BACKGROUND: Malaria chemoprophylaxis options in pregnancy are limited, and atovaquone-proguanil (AP) is not recommended because of insufficient safety evidence. An anonymous, internet-based survey was disseminated to describe outcomes of pregnancies accidentally exposed to AP. Outcomes of interest included miscarriage (defined as pregnancy loss before 20 weeks), stillbirth (defined as pregnancy loss at or after 20 weeks), preterm birth or live birth prior to 37 weeks, and the presence of congenital anomalies. RESULTS: A total of 487 women responded and reported on 822 pregnancies. Of the 807 pregnancies with information available on exposure and outcomes, 10 (1.2%) had atovaquone-proguanil exposure, all in the first trimester, and all resulted in term births with no birth defects. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an anti-malarial not recommended in pregnancy is likely to occur before the woman knows of her pregnancy. This study adds to the limited evidence of the safety of AP in pregnancy. Further study on use of AP in pregnancy should be a high priority, as an alternative option for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in non-immune travellers is urgently needed.

29934423	2019/8/23	Daclizumab	Eosinophilia	Case Reports_and_Journal Article_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	1	1	0	0	0	Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms after daclizumab therapy.	OBJECTIVE: To report on 2 women with multiple sclerosis (MS) who developed severe neurologic deterioration and a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) after treatment with 2 and 4 subcutaneous injections of daclizumab, respectively. METHODS: This report includes clinical, MRI, and histopathologic data. RESULTS: Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the interleukin-2 receptor. It was approved for the treatment of relapsing MS. DRESS is an immunologic reaction to various medications that is characterized by eosinophilia as well as cutaneous and visceral manifestations. Following daclizumab treatment, both patients showed fulminant neurologic deterioration along with blood eosinophilia and skin changes, and both fulfilled the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of DRESS. They presented with multiple gadolinium-enhancing supra- and infratentorial lesions, with lesions in the basal ganglia, mesencephalon, and cerebellum. Brain biopsies revealed a pronounced inflammatory infiltrate including numerous eosinophils infiltrating demyelinating lesions, a feature that is atypical for MS but compatible with DRESS. In addition, numerous plasma cells and changes reminiscent of vasculitis were evident. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic deterioration and DRESS occurred as severe adverse drug effects of daclizumab treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of DRESS are essential because it is associated with complications such as new autoimmune diseases and liver failure, and may even be lethal. Because of its potential serious side effects, daclizumab was recently suspended for use in the European Union.

A 61-year-old woman presented with metastatic breast cancer in her right lung 4 years and 11 months after the operation for her right breast cancer(HER2 enriched type). Chemotherapy(pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel)were ad- ministered. On day 2 of cycle 2, pegfilgrastim was administered because her neutrophils decreased to 54 cells/mL on day 8 of cycle 1. On day 9 of cycle 2, she developed left neck and chest pain. Moreover, she developed a fever of 39 degrees C on day 14 and visited our hospital. Her WBC and CRP increased to 18,300 cells/mL and 25.48mg/dL, respectively. Computed tomography revealed an increased CT value of the panniculus, around the aorta and left pleural effusion. Ultrasonography of the neck showed a marginal hypoechoic area around the left carotid artery, which corresponded with the pain. Arteritis induced by PFG was suspected. The neck pain and fever almost completely improved 19 days later, and cycle 3 was performed 28 days after cycle 2. To our knowledge, the present case is the second report of arteritis that was suspected to be associated with PFG.

We report a diagnosis of exogenous steroid-induced hypoadrenalism in a person living with HIV caused by a drug-drug interaction (DDI) between intrabursal triamcinolone and the pharmacokinetic booster cobicistat. A 53-year-old woman living with HIV, managed with dolutegravir and cobicistat-boosted darunavir, presented to the orthopaedic clinic with worsening hip pain. She was diagnosed with greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) of the hip and was treated with intrabursal injection of bupivacaine and triamcinolone. Seven days following this injection, she presented with Cushingoid features, an undetectable cortisol and was diagnosed with exogenous steroid-induced hypoadrenalism. Cobicistat is a cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor and in this case inhibited clearance of intrabursal triamcinolone, leading to exogenous glucocorticoid excess and adrenal suppression. This is the first report to describe this predictable DDI with cobicistat following intrabursal glucocorticoid injection. This case highlights the complexities in managing non-HIV-related chronic morbidities in people living with HIV.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis impairs the quality of life. The difference in severity of oral mucositis between different anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies combined with cytotoxic drugs in colorectal cancer is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in oral mucositis between panitumumab (Pmab) and cetuximab (Cmab) combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. A total of 75 colorectal cancer outpatients treated with an anti-EGFR antibody combined with FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, or 5-FU/leucovorin as the first- to third-line treatment were included. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade 2-3 oral mucositis. The secondary endpoint was the time to onset of oral mucositis. We also compared the incidence of toxicities of interest, skin toxicity, hypomagnesaemia and neutropenia, and time to treatment failure (TTF) between the two groups. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients treated with Pmab and 43 patients treated with Cmab were evaluated. Patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. The incidence of grade 2-3 oral mucositis was significantly higher with Pmab than with Cmab (31.3% vs 9.3%, P < 0.05). Moreover, the incidence of grade 3 oral mucositis was significantly higher in patients treated with Pmab (18.8% vs 0%, P < 0.01). The mean (SD) cycles to onset of the worst oral mucositis was 3.0 (2.9) in the Pmab group and 2.3 (1.7) in the Cmab group (P = 0.29). Oral mucositis was characterized by glossitis and cheilitis. The incidences of other toxicities were the following (Pmab vs Cmab): grade 2-3 skin toxicity: 68.8% vs 74.4% (P = 0.61), grade 2-3 hypomagnesaemia: 9.3% vs 7.0% (P = 1.00), grade 3-4 neutropenia: 28.1% vs 37.2% (P = 0.46). The median TTF was not significantly different, i.e., 223 days vs 200 days (P = 0.39) for Pmab vs Cmab. CONCLUSIONS: Pmab-based chemotherapy resulted in significantly higher grades of oral mucositis compared with Cmab-based chemotherapy. The oral condition should be monitored carefully and early supportive care should be provided for patients treated with Pmab-based chemotherapy.

Our objective is to clarify relationship between reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and administrating etanercept during puerperium. Several lines of evidence have suggested tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as a mediator of vascular dysfunction associated with estrogen deficiency. A 32-year-old woman resumed etanercept (25 mg/week), a TNF inhibitor, which had been discontinued during pregnancy, because of the deterioration of rheumatoid arthritis. She was admitted to our hospital with upper right quadrant blindness and mild right hemiparesis accompanied by pulsating left occipital pain, which had appeared 4 hours after restarting etanercept (25 mg/week). Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed acute left hippocampal infarction with multiple segmental stenoses of the main intracranial arteries. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome was diagnosed based on improvement of the multiple stenoses on magnetic resonance angiography on hospital day 17. A causal relationship was considered to exist between TNF inhibition by etanercept and multiple cerebral vasoconstrictions with brain infarct in this puerperant.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic diseases are on the rise and are associated with weight gain. Multidisciplinary strategies are required for its control. METHODS: The design was descriptive, observational and retrospective. The objectives of this communication were to describe the demographic and clinical characteristics and adverse reactions of overweight and obese people who were consumers of orlistat, attended by a call center during the period 2009 to 2017; and to identify the healthcare professional most consulted by them. The information was obtained from an existing database of a program of attention to people with overweight or obesity, interested in using orlistat (prospects) or users (patients). The study was carried out in Mexico and lasted seven years. The variables studied were demographic, clinical and adverse reactions. RESULTS: A total of 311,913 requests were collected from 126 607 subjects (104 711 prospects interested in consuming orlistat and 21 896 patients who already took it). The main activities were phone calls to the subject (35.9%). There were 104 711 requests: 82 810 (79.1%) prospects and 21 896 (20.9%) patients. 79.9% of all were female. The predominant age interval was 32 to 45 years. 43 adverse reactions (0.02%) were detected; the most common were abdominal pain (0.05%) and headache (0.03%). CONCLUSIONS: The population most interested in weight control in this study was the female population (79.9%) and the age group from 32 to 45 years. The most consulted healthcare professional was the nutritionist. Only the body mass index (29.2 kilograms per square meter) of the subjects who developed 43 adverse reactions was obtained. There were 43 adverse reactions, the most common being abdominal pain and headache.

INTRODUCTION: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with a dose and duration-dependent coronary risk. There is little information concerning analgesic-dose ibuprofen, among the most widely used drugs worldwide. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to measure the risks of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after dispensing of ibuprofen, versus paracetamol. METHODS: Propensity score 1:2-matched cohorts of ibuprofen or paracetamol treatment episodes (TEs) in Echantillon Generaliste de Beneficiaires (EGB), the 1/97 sample of Systeme National des Donnees de Sante (SNDS), the French nationwide claims database, from 2009 to 2014, were compared. Outcomes were hospital admissions for ACS during the 3 months after the dispensing of ibuprofen or paracetamol. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated overall and stratified on low-dose aspirin dispensing. RESULTS: A total of 315,269 ibuprofen TEs in 168,400 persons were matched to 630,457 paracetamol TEs in 395,952 patients. Event rates were 50-100 times higher in low-dose aspirin users (27 vs 0.28 per 1000 patient years). Overall there was no difference in risk of ACS at 3 months (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74-1.20) despite a transient increase in the first 2 weeks in ibuprofen users (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.11-2.59). In the stratified analysis, this short-term risk was only found in aspirin users (5% of population, HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.24-3.24), but not in non-aspirin users (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.40-2.94). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence for an increased risk of ACS in patients dispensed ibuprofen compared to paracetamol.

BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates prevent fractures in patients with osteoporosis, but their efficacy in women with osteopenia is unknown. Most fractures in postmenopausal women occur in those with osteopenia, so therapies that are effective in women with osteopenia are needed. METHODS: We conducted a 6-year, double-blind trial involving 2000 women with osteopenia (defined by a T score of -1.0 to -2.5 at either the total hip or the femoral neck on either side) who were 65 years of age or older. Participants were randomly assigned to receive four infusions of either zoledronate at a dose of 5 mg (zoledronate group) or normal saline (placebo group) at 18-month intervals. A dietary calcium intake of 1 g per day was advised, but calcium supplements were not provided. Participants who were not already taking vitamin D supplements received cholecalciferol before the trial began (a single dose of 2.5 mg) and during the trial (1.25 mg per month). The primary end point was the time to first occurrence of a nonvertebral or vertebral fragility fracture. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean (+/-SD) age was 71+/-5 years, the T score at the femoral neck was -1.6+/-0.5, and the median 10-year risk of hip fracture was 2.3%. A fragility fracture occurred in 190 women in the placebo group and in 122 women in the zoledronate group (hazard ratio with zoledronate, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.79; P<0.001). The number of women that would need to be treated to prevent the occurrence of a fracture in 1 woman was 15. As compared with the placebo group, women who received zoledronate had a lower risk of nonvertebral fragility fractures (hazard ratio, 0.66; P=0.001), symptomatic fractures (hazard ratio, 0.73; P=0.003), vertebral fractures (odds ratio, 0.45; P=0.002), and height loss (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of nonvertebral or vertebral fragility fractures was significantly lower in women with osteopenia who received zoledronate than in women who received placebo.

30137217	2019/7/6	Cilostazol	Migraine with Aura	Journal Article_and_Randomized Controlled Trial_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	1	1	0	0	0	Induction of migraine-like headache, but not aura, by cilostazol in patients with migraine with aura.	Whether migraine headache and migraine aura share common pathophysiological mechanisms remains to be understood. Cilostazol causes cAMP accumulation and provokes migraine-like headache in migraine patients without aura. We investigated if cilostazol induces aura and migraine-like headache in patients with migraine with aura and alters peripheral endothelial function and levels of endothelial markers. In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study, 16 patients with migraine with aura (of whom 12 patients exclusively had attacks of migraine with aura) received 200 mg cilostazol (Pletal(R)) or placebo on two separate days. The development, duration, and characteristics of aura and headache were recorded using a questionnaire. Peripheral endothelial function was assessed by digital pulse amplitude tonometry using EndoPAT2000, and endothelial markers (VCAM1, E-selectin, and VEGFA) were measured. After administration of cilostazol, 14 patients (88%) experienced headache compared with six patients (38%) after placebo (P = 0.009). The headache in 12 patients (75%) after cilostazol and one patient (6%) after placebo fulfilled the criteria for migraine-like attacks (P = 0.0002). Patients reported that the attack mimicked the headache phase during their usual migraine attacks. However, aura symptoms were elicited in one patient after cilostazol and one patient after placebo. Further, endothelial function, as assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry, and endothelial markers were not significantly altered by cilostazol. Accumulation of cAMP by cilostazol induces migraine-like headache, but not aura, in patients with migraine with aura, even in those who exclusively reported attacks of migraine with aura in their spontaneous attacks. These findings further support dissociation between the aura and the headache phase with a yet unknown trigger for the aura and link between aura and headache. In addition, cilostazol administration did not significantly alter endothelial function, as assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry, or the endothelial markers, VCAM1, E-selectin, and VEGFA. However, post hoc analyses showed that our study was statistically underpowered for these outcomes.

PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials suggest an increased risk of heart failure with dutasteride, which inhibits both the type 1 and type 2 isoforms of 5alpha-reductase. In contrast, no such association has been suggested for finasteride, which selectively inhibits the type 2 isoform. We investigated the risk of cardiovascular events among patients receiving dutasteride relative to finasteride. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a population based cohort study of Ontario men 66 years old or older who commenced treatment with dutasteride or finasteride between October 1, 2005 and March 31, 2015. For each individual treated with dutasteride, we identified 1 treated with finasteride, matching on a propensity score and calendar quarter of treatment initiation to account for temporal changes in prescribing. The primary outcome was hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary analyses were done to examine acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for differences between groups. RESULTS: We studied 36,311 men who commenced dutasteride and 36,311 treated with finasteride. In the primary analysis, we found no difference in the risk of heart failure among patients receiving dutasteride relative to those receiving finasteride (adjusted HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.08). Similarly, we found no difference in the risk of acute myocardial infarction (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.08) or stroke (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this population based cohort study of more than 72,000 older men, dutasteride was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events relative to finasteride.

29778846	2019/3/6	Lacosamide	Vomiting	Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	Efficacy and tolerability of treatment with lacosamide: Postmarketing experience from the Middle East region.	PURPOSE: Lacosamide (LCM) was recently introduced in the Middle East. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LCM in patients with focal onset seizures and determine if our results are comparable with those derived from Western countries. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis from two medical centers on consecutive patients diagnosed as having focal onset seizures and treated with add-on LCM. The primary efficacy variables were the 50% responder and seizure-free rates, and the secondary outcome variables included the percentages of patients who achieved seizure remission during the last 6-month follow-up period and the percentages of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or tolerability. RESULTS: One hundred four patients with a mean age of 30.9 years and experiencing a mean of 9.4 seizures per month during baseline were included. The 50% responder rates were 69% and 70% at 6- and 24-month follow-ups, respectively. Patients concomitantly treated with a sodium channel blocker were less likely to achieve seizure remission during the last 6-month follow-up period while the early introduction of LCM resulted in a significantly higher likelihood of achieving such a remission. Eighty-eight percent of patients were still maintained on LCM at the last follow-up, and the most common adverse events consisted of dizziness and somnolence, double vision, and nausea/vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show similar efficacy and tolerability to those reported from Western countries. Our results also substantiate the early introduction of LCM and support the dose reduction of baseline AED especially that of sodium channel blockers to minimize adverse events.

BACKGROUND: Cilostazol is an antiplatelet drug that is widely prescribed for the prevention of secondary stroke. Adverse reactions to cilostazol include headaches, palpitations, and diarrhea. Little is known about the nephrotoxicity of cilostazol, such as acute kidney injury. We report a biopsy-proven case of diffuse tubulointerstitial nephritis induced by cilostazol. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old woman prescribed cilostazol was hospitalized for acute kidney injury. On admission, her renal function deteriorated, with an increased serum creatinine level. Urinalysis showed hematuria, proteinuria, and hyper-beta2-microglobulinuria. A renal biopsy revealed diffuse tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with IgA nephropathy, and gallium-67 scintigraphy showed uptake in the bilateral kidneys. A drug lymphocyte stimulation test for cilostazol was positive, and the patient was diagnosed with cilostazol-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Despite discontinuation of cilostazol, her renal function rapidly worsened and steroid pulse therapy was initiated, followed by oral high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. After steroid treatment, her serum creatinine level normalized in parallel with urine beta2-microglobulin. CONCLUSION: Cilostazol can induce acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.

INTRODUCTION: Patients treated by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) represent 1% of the population in France. We report a case of atypical necrotic leg ulcers induced by VKA. CASE REPORT: A 84-year-old woman was referred to our dermatology department because of necrotic leg ulcers that developed for the past 5weeks, and appeared spontaneously after the introduction of a VKA, fluindione. The etiological assessment was non contributive, in particular the search for thrombophilic factors. The skin biopsy found an aspect compatible with pyoderma gangrenosum. The outcome was favorable after discontinuing the fluindione and the switch to apixaban. A complete healing was obtained in 5months. CONCLUSION: We report an original case of necrotic leg ulcers induced by VKA without deficit of protein C or S, with a pyoderma like histology. Reported cases of ulcers induced by VKA are uncommon and the physiopathology is not well known. The involvement of VKA should be evoked in case of necrotic leg ulcer without specific etiology found.

This article aims to provide the reader with an overview of MGA's impact on hemostasis, as well as a review of therapeutics on appetite stimulants and important transitions of care considerations for GFTT.<br/> SETTING: The primary setting was a community teaching hospital in Florida. The patient had many transitions of care, including hospital-to-skilled nursing facility and then a hospital readmission for the primary problem reported here. A skilled nursing facility medication administration record and outpatient community pharmacy were the primary sources of the patient's admission and discharge medication histories.<br/> PRACTICE CONSIDERATIONS: MGA's published labeling supports a prothrombotic mechanism; however, its pharmacology may also confer anticoagulant properties. This may lead to potential drug-drug interactions in patients on concomitant anticoagulant therapy. There is weak evidence supporting appetite stimulants in GFTT, and transitions of care in this population is especially important because of these patients' frequent care continuum contact.<br/> CONCLUSIONS: MGA, a synthetic derivative of endogenous progesterone used to treat GFTT, may exert either prothrombotic or anticoagulant effects, and as such potential for drug interactions with anticoagulants must be considered. Patients taking MGA should be closely monitored for coagulation changes throughout transitions of care.

A 30-year-old pregnant female presented with a 2-week history of pityriasis rosea-like eruption. The rash started 2 days after the patient had started taking ondansetron 8 mg for alleviation of moderate-to-severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Physical examination revealed erythematous papulosquamous lesions characterized by annular scaly margins and a dusky centre over the arms, chest, abdomen, lower back and legs. The rash did not involve the palms, sole or mucous membranes, and no lesions were observed on the lymph nodes. Ondansetron was discontinued. The rash ceased to spread and started to disappear within 2 weeks with full resolution noted after 1 month. Analysis of the case using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated that ondansetron was the probable cause of the pityriasis rosea-like eruption. This is the first case report of pityriasis rosea related to ondansetron therapy.

Neonatal seizures represent a significant health burden on the term and preterm neonatal population and are linked to poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved antiepileptic drugs for neonates, and authors of the medical literature have yet to reach a consensus on the most adequate approach to neonatal seizures. Topiramate is readily used in the adult and older pediatric population for the management of migraines and partial-onset seizures. Topiramate continues to gain favor among pediatric neurologists who often recommend this medication as a third-line treatment of neonatal seizures. We report our recent experience with 4 preterm neonates, born between 2015 and 2017, who developed radiographic signs of necrotizing enterocolitis after receiving topiramate for seizures. Each was given oral topiramate for the treatment of electrographic and clinical seizures and developed the subsequent diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis, with abdominal distention, hemoccult-positive stools, and radiographic signs of intestinal distention and pneumatosis. More research regarding the risk factors of topiramate use in premature infants is needed.
29879262	2018/10/16	Benzoyl Peroxide	Exanthema	Journal Article_and_Review	0	0	0	0	0	Topical Vehicle Formulations in the Treatment of Acne.	Topical treatment is the mainstay of acne therapy. The most commonly prescribed topical medications for acne include benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and retinoids. Despite their effectiveness in treating mild to moderate acne vulgaris, these topical medications are found to be irritating, and are historically associated with poor tolerability and diminished patient adherence. Thus, choosing the right formulation that will be effective and well tolerated is essential. Novel formulations that optimize drug concentration and utilize improved delivery vehicles have helped to enhance the tolerability and efficacy, and allow for less frequent application or co-application of drugs that were previously considered incompatible. This article will review the goals of topical therapy for the treatment of acne, in addition to common therapies and their challenges. Advanced formulations and combination formulations of benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, and tretinoin will also be discussed. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(6 Suppl):s6-10.
31286241	2019/8/29	Carboplatin	Late Onset Disorders	Journal Article	0	1	0	0	0	Adjuvant carboplatin therapy in patients with clinical stage 1 testicular seminoma: is long-term morbidity increased?	PURPOSE: Clinical stage (CS) 1 testicular seminoma is cured in almost 100% of cases following either retroperitoneal radiotherapy, carboplatin monotherapy, or surveillance strategies. Little is known about potential long-term effects of carboplatin. We, therefore, examined late sequelae of this drug in seminoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 451 patients with CS1 testicular seminoma treated between 1994 and 2014, of whom 243 underwent carboplatin therapy [median follow-up (F/U) 96 months], 81 received radiotherapy (median F/U 142 months), and 127 underwent surveillance (median F/U 40 months). Satisfaction regarding management, as well as the following events during F/U, were analysed by questionnaire: subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs), cardiovascular events, arterial hypertension, peptic ulcer, tinnitus, peripheral neuropathy, hypogonadism, and infertility. The relative frequencies of the events were analysed using descriptive statistics. The frequency of observed SMNs was compared with the expected number. RESULTS: Patients receiving carboplatin tolerated the treatment less well (71.2%) than those under surveillance (81.9%). After carboplatin, 12 SMNs (5.0%) were noted vis-a-vis 5.0 expected. There were three cases of prostatic cancer and 3 melanomas among the SMNs. Half of these SMNs occurred early after treatment. Among the other health events, only reported hypogonadism (13.2%) appeared to be marginally increased in frequency. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a 2.4-fold higher than expected rate of SMN-and a slightly increased rate of hypogonadism-in the long-term period following carboplatin treatment. Although further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, these results are probably informative for clinicians caring for seminoma patients.
29656050	2019/8/7	Panobinostat	Dehydration	Clinical Trial_and_Journal Article_and_Multicenter Study_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	0	0	0	0	0	An Expanded Treatment Protocol of Panobinostat Plus Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in Patients With Previously Treated Myeloma.	BACKGROUND: Panobinostat was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Commission in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma who have received >/= 2 regimens, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug. The PANEX (panobinostat expansion) treatment protocol provided access to panobinostat and gathered additional safety data before commercial availability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In treatment phase 1, patients received panobinostat 20 mg 3 times per week plus bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) twice weekly with dexamethasone 20 mg on the days of and after bortezomib treatment. Patients with no change or better in treatment phase 1 proceeded to treatment phase 2, when bortezomib was reduced to once weekly. Unlike in the phase III trial, PANORAMA-1 (panobinostat or placebo with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma), bortezomib could be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with a median number of previous treatments of 4 (range, 1-12) were enrolled; most received subcutaneous bortezomib (87%). The overall response rate (partial response or better) was 56%. Grade 3/4 adverse events included thrombocytopenia (47%), fatigue (31%), dehydration (26%), and diarrhea (18%). Among the patients who received subcutaneous bortezomib, relatively low rates of peripheral neuropathy (all grade, 15%) and notable grade 3/4 adverse events (thrombocytopenia, 47%; diarrhea, 12%) were observed. CONCLUSION: Overall, data from the PANEX trial support regulatory approval of panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone and suggest the potential tolerability benefits of subcutaneous bortezomib in this regimen.

29031417	2018/12/12	Meropenem	Hyperpigmentation	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	1	1	2	[Skin pigmentation induced by meropenem and levofloxacin].	BACKGROUND: Various cutaneous side-effects, including, exanthema, pruritus, urticaria and Lyell or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, have been reported with meropenem (carbapenem), a rarely-prescribed antibiotic. Levofloxacin (fluoroquinolone), a more frequently prescribed antibiotic, has similar cutaneous side-effects, as well as photosensitivity. We report a case of cutaneous hyperpigmentation induced by meropenem and levofloxacin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 67-year-old male was treated with meropenem (1gx4 daily), levofloxacin (500mg twice daily) and amikacin (500mg daily) for 2 weeks, followed by meropenem, levofloxacin and rifampicin (600mg twice daily) for 4 weeks for osteitis of the fifth metatarsal. Three weeks after initiation of antibiotic therapy, dark hyperpigmentation appeared on the lower limbs, predominantly on the anterior aspects of the legs. Histology revealed dark, perivascular and interstitial deposits throughout the dermis, which stained with both Fontana-Masson and Perls stains. Infrared microspectroscopy revealed meropenem in the dermis of involved skin. After withdrawal of the antibiotics, the pigmentation subsided slowly. DISCUSSION: Similar cases of cutaneous hyperpigmentation have been reported after use of minocycline. In these cases, histological examination also showed iron and/or melanin deposits within the dermis, but the nature of the causative pigment remains unclear. In our case, infrared spectroscopy enabled us to identify meropenem in the dermis. Two cases of cutaneous hyperpigmentation have been reported following use of levofloxacin, and the results of histological examination were similar. This is the first case of cutaneous hyperpigmentation induced by meropenem.

29398013	2018/12/15	Acrylamide	Pediatric Obesity	Journal Article_and_Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	1	1	0	0	0	Dietary acrylamide intake during pregnancy and postnatal growth and obesity: Results from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).	BACKGROUND: Prenatal acrylamide exposure has been negatively associated with fetal growth but the association with child growth is unknown. OBJECTIVES: We studied the association between prenatal acrylamide exposure and child postnatal growth up to 8 years in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). METHODS: In 51,952 mother-child pairs from MoBa, acrylamide intake during pregnancy was estimated by combining maternal food intake with food concentrations of acrylamide. Mothers reported their child's weight and length/height up to 11 times between 6 weeks and 8 years. Weight and height growth trajectories were modelled using Jenss-Bayley's growth model. Logistic regression models were used to study the association with overweight/obese status at 3, 5 and 8 years, as identified using the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs. Linear mixed-effect models were used to explore associations with overall growth. RESULTS: At 3 years, the adjusted odds ratios (95% Confidence Intervals (CI)) of being overweight/obese were 1.10 (1.02, 1.20), 1.12 (1.04, 1.22) and 1.21 (1.11, 1.31) by increasing prenatal acrylamide exposure quartile. Similar dose-response associations were found at 5 and 8 years. Acrylamide intake during pregnancy was associated with higher weight growth velocity in childhood. Children exposed at the highest level had 22 g (95% CI: 8, 37), 57 g (95% CI: 32, 81), and 194 g (95% CI: 110, 278) higher weight at 0.5, 2, and 8 years, respectively, compared to their low exposed peers. CONCLUSIONS: Children prenatally exposed to acrylamide in the highest quartile experienced a moderate increase in weight growth velocity during early childhood that resulted in a moderately increased prevalence of overweight/obesity compared to peers in the lowest quartile. Our study is the first to link prenatal acrylamide exposure and postnatal growth.

The venous thromboembolism risk among anti-osteoporotics is unknown. In this primary care study, the risk with other bisphosphonates [1.05 (0.94-1.18) and 0.96 (0.78-1.18)], strontium [0.90 (0.61-1.34) and 1.19 (0.82-1.74)], in the UK and Spain respectively, and denosumab [1.77 (0.25-12.66)] and teriparatide [1.27 (0.59-2.71)] in Spain, did not differ versus alendronate. INTRODUCTION: Most of the known adverse drug reactions described for anti-osteoporosis medication (AOM) have been described in studies comparing AOM users to non-users. We aimed to compare the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among incident users of different AOM compared to alendronate (first line therapy). METHODS: Two cohort studies were performed using data from the UK (CPRD) and Spain (BIFAP) primary care records separately. All patients aged >/= 50 years with at least 1 year of data available and a new prescription or dispensation of AOM (date for therapy initiation) during 2000-2014 (CPRD) or 2001-2013 (BIFAP) were included. Users of raloxifene/bazedoxifene were excluded from both databases. Five exposure cohorts were identified according to first treatment: (1) alendronate, (2) other bisphosphonates, (3) strontium ranelate, (4) denosumab, and (5) teriparatide. Participants were followed from the day after therapy initiation to the earliest of a treated VTE (cases), end of AOM treatment (defined by a refill gap of 180 days), switching to an alternative AOM, drop-out, death, or end of study period. Incidence rates of VTE were estimated by cohort. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR 95%CI) were estimated according to drug used. RESULTS: Overall, 2035/159,209 (1.28%) in CPRD and 401/83,334 (0.48%) in BIFAP had VTE. Compared to alendronate, adjusted HR of VTE were 1.05 (0.94-1.18) and 0.96 (0.78-1.18) for other bisphosphonates, and 0.90 (0.61-1.34) and 1.19 (0.82-1.74) for strontium in CPRD and BIFAP, respectively; 1.77 (0.25-12.66) for denosumab and 1.27 (0.59-2.71) for teriparatide in BIFAP. CONCLUSIONS: VTE risk during AO therapy did not differ by AOM drug use. Our data does not support an increased risk of VTE associated with strontium ranelate use in the community.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is an idiopathic interstitial lung disease with nonspecific symptoms that involves a complex inflammatory cascade. CASE STUDY: A 36-year-old prisoner with a history of psoriasis presented with progressive worsening dyspnea, chest pain, and cough. His symptoms started 2-months after starting adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor, for psoriasis treatment. RESULTS: Initial workup revealed 27% eosinophils on complete blood count, elevated IgE levels on bronchoalveolar lavage, and bilateral peripheral lung opacities on imaging. The patient's symptoms and eosinophilia improved markedly after starting corticosteroids. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with CEP. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case of asthma and CEP in a patient taking adalimumab. We suspect adalimumab unmasked the Th2 cell pathway response that was otherwise suppressed by psoriasis, a primarily Th1 cell pathway disease. The patient's pulmonary changes can be attributed to an eosinophilic asthma phenotype with adalimumab putatively indirectly causing CEP.

Kounis syndrome is defined as the coincidental occurrence of an acute coronary syndrome with hypersensitivity reactions following an allergic event. The three reported variants of Kounis syndrome are vasospastic allergic angina, allergic myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis with occluding thrombus. The syndrome is caused by various inflammatory mediators. The pathophysiological characteristics of Kounis syndrome involve coronary artery spasm and/or atheromatous plaque erosion or rupture during an allergic reaction. Several causes have been described to induce Kounis syndrome, and their number is increasing rapidly. The haemodynamic effect of the syndrome complicated by cardiogenic shock seems to combine allergic shock with extensive peripheral vasodilation and myocardial suppression with the characteristics of cardiogenic shock. Treatment of Kounis syndrome is challenging because it needs management of both cardiac and allergic manifestation simultaneously. We present a case report of type I Kounis syndrome, with coronary spasm secondary to cefuroxime injection complicated with cardiogenic shock. A brief review of the literature on the various facets of this condition is also provided.

INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The carcinogenesis of tubular and papillary cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) differ. The available epidemiologic studies about risk factors for CCA do not differentiate between the tubular and papillary type. The current study investigated the relationship between the number of repeated use of Praziquantel (PZQ) treatments and each type of CCA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a hospital-based, matched, case-control study of patients admitted to Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University. The patients were 210 pathologically-confirmed cases of CCA, while the controls were 840 subjects diagnosed with other diseases. The 4 controls were individually matched with each case by sex, age, and date of admission. The cases were classified according to location (intrahepatic vs. extrahepatic) and cell type (papillary vs. tubular). Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used for the analysis. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders, there were statistically significant associations between intrahepatic and papillary CCA and repeated use of PZQ treatment. The respective odds of developing intrahepatic CCA for those who used PZQ once, twice, or more was 1.54 (95%CI:0.92-2.55 ), 2.28 (95%CI:0.91-5.73), and 4.21 (95%CI:1.61-11.05). The respective odds of developing papillary CCA for those who used PZQ once, twice, or more was 1.45 (95%CI:0.80-2.63), 2.96 (95%CI:1.06-8.24), and 3.24 (95%CI:1.09-9.66). There was no association between number of uses of PZQ treatment and developing extrahepatic or tubular CCA. CONCLUSION: The current study found an association between papillary and intrahepatic CCA and repeated use of PZQ treatment. We suggest further study on the risk factors for papillary and tubular CCA should be performed separately.

OBJECTIVE: To perform an expedited assessment of cancer risk associated with exposure to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) through contaminated valsartan products. DESIGN: Nationwide cohort study. SETTING: Danish health registries on individual level prescription drug use, cancer occurrence, and hospital diagnoses. PARTICIPANTS: 5150 Danish patients with no history of cancer, aged 40 years or older, and using valsartan at 1 January 2012 or initiating use between 1 January 2012 and 30 June 2017. Participants were followed from one year after cohort entry (lag time period) until experiencing a cancer outcome, death, migration, or end of study period (30 June 2018). Each participant's exposure to NDMA (ever exposure and predefined categories of cumulative valsartan exposure) was mapped out as a time varying variable while also applying a one year lag. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association between NDMA exposure and a primary composite endpoint comprising all cancers except non-melanoma skin cancer, estimated using Cox regression. In supplementary analyses, the risk of individual cancers was determined. RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 5150 people followed for a median of 4.6 years. In total, 3625 cohort participants contributed 7344 person years classified as unexposed to NDMA, and 3450 participants contributed 11 920 person years classified as ever exposed to NDMA. With 104 cancer outcomes among NDMA unexposed participants and 198 among exposed participants, the adjusted hazard ratio for overall cancer was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.41), with no evidence of a dose-response relation (P=0.70). For single cancer outcomes, increases in risk were observed for colorectal cancer (hazard ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 2.73) and for uterine cancer (1.81, 0.55 to 5.90), although with wide confidence intervals that included the null. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not imply a markedly increased short term overall risk of cancer in users of valsartan contaminated with NDMA. However, uncertainty persists about single cancer outcomes, and studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess long term cancer risk.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPis) have revolutionised survival outcomes for cancer patients by bolstering anti-tumour immunity. However, immune activation also occurs in non-cancer tissue, and a significant proportion of patients develop immune-mediated colitis, which can be fatal if not promptly recognised and managed. Diagnosis is often made by inflammation observed during lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. Little is known about microscopic inflammation (histological findings of inflammation in the absence of overt mucosal injury). Management strategies beyond the use of systemic corticosteroids, which incur a high burden of deleterious side effects, have not been extensively explored. We describe the cases of two cancer patients with ICPi-induced colitis who had isolated histoloigical features of colitis in the absence of macroscopic disease. Sustained clinical and histological remission was induced with the topical steroid preparation, beclometasone dipropionate (Clipper), with no adverse effects.

Ethambutol (EMB) and isoniazid (INH) are the first-line antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs. However, their neurotoxicity could cause adverse effect and the patients with end-stage renal disease are especially vulnerable due to the reduction in renal drug clearance. Here, we report a 36-year-old man receiving peritoneal dialysis developed progressive paralysis in lower extremities, vision loss and hoarseness 4 months after anti-TB treatment with INH, EMB and rifapentine because of concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis. A diagnosis of EMB/INH-induced peripheral neuropathy, retrobulbar neuritis and laryngoparalysis was made. The patient's neuropathy gradually improved 2 years after discontinuation of EMB/INH. Since EMB and INH may cause simultaneously severe and complex multineuropathy in dialysis patients, their adverse effects should be closely supervised in dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Major differences exist between men and women in both physiology and pathophysiology. Dissecting the underlying processes and contributing mechanisms of sex differences in health and disease represents a crucial step towards precision medicine. Considering the significant differences between men and women in the response to pharmacotherapies, our aim was to develop an in silico model able to predict sex-specific drug responses in a large-scale. METHODS: For this purpose, we focused on cardiovascular effects because of their high morbidity and mortality. Our model predicted several drugs (including acebutolol and tacrine) with significant differences in the heart between men and women. To validate the sex-specific drug responses identified by our model, acebutolol was selected to lower blood pressure in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR), tacrine was used to assess cardiac injury in mice and metformin as control for a non-sex-specific response. RESULTS: As our model predicted, acebutolol exhibited a stronger decrease in heart rate and blood pressure in female than male SHRs. Tacrine lowered heart rate in male but not in female mice, induced higher plasma cTNI level and increased cardiac superoxide (DHE staining) generation in female than male mice, indicating stronger cardiac toxicity in female than male mice. To validate our model in humans, we employed two Chinese cohorts, which showed that among patients taking a beta-receptor blocker (metoprolol), women reached significantly lower diastolic blood pressure than men. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that our in silico model could be translated into clinical practice to predict sex-specific drug responses, thereby contributing towards a more appropriate medical care for both men and women.

29525051	2019/1/15	Ketamine	Essential Hypertension	Journal Article	1	0	0	0	0	Blood pressure safety of subanesthetic ketamine for depression: A report on 684 infusions.	BACKGROUND: The dissociative anesthetic agent ketamine is increasingly being utilized to treat depression, despite not having FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approval for this indication. There are many questions about the potential risks of this treatment and hence the proper setting and degree of monitoring required to ensure patient safety. There is limited data about the cardiovascular safety of ketamine when administered at subanesthetic doses to treat depression. METHODS: 66 patients in the Department of Psychiatry at Emory University received a total of 684 ketamine infusions between 2014 and 2016. Ketamine was dosed at 0.5 mg/kg body weight and infused over 40 min. Blood pressure was measured every 10 min during the infusions and every 15 min thereafter. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 56.7 years, 87.9% had unipolar depression and 36.1% had essential hypertension. No infusions were discontinued due to instability of vital signs, adverse physiological consequences or acute psychotomimetic effects. The biggest increases in blood pressure were measured at 30 min (systolic 3.28 mmHg, diastolic 3.17 mmHg). Hypertensive patients had higher blood pressure peaks during the infusions. Blood pressures returned to baseline during post-infusion monitoring. There was no development of tolerance to the blood pressure elevating effects of ketamine between the first and sixth infusions. LIMITATIONS: This is a single site, retrospective analysis, of patients who were spontaneously seeking clinical care. CONCLUSIONS: The blood pressure changes observed when ketamine is administered over 40 min at 0.5 mg/kg for the treatment of depression are small, well tolerated and clinically insignificant.

Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) is a common autoimmune disorder. The possible pathogenic role and mechanism of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in CLT is still controversial. Experiments were conducted after 35-days of oral exposure to the three concentrations of DBP or saline, and three immunizations with thyroglobulin (TG). Healthy female Wistar rats were randomly divided into ten exposure groups (n = 8 each): (A) saline control, (B) 0.5 mg/kg/d DBP, (C) 5 mg/kg/d DBP, (D) 50 mg/kg/d DBP, (E) TG-immunized group, (F) TG- combined with 0.5 mg/kg/d DBP, (G) TG- combined with 5 mg/kg/d DBP, (H) TG- combined with 50 mg/kg/d DBP, (I) TG- combined with 50 mg/kg/d DBP plus 100 mg/kg/d vitamin C; (J) 100 mg/kg/d vitamin C. We showed that oral exposure DBP can aggravate CLT in rats. This deterioration was concomitant with increased thyroid auto antibodies, Th1/Th2 imbalance and Th17 immune response, activated pro-inflammatory and apoptosis pathways, and increased thyroid dysfunction in rats. Our results also suggested that DBP could promote oxidative damage. The study also found that vitamin C reduced the levels of oxidative stress and alleviated CLT. In short, the study showed that DBP exacerbated CLT through oxidative stress.

RATIONALE: Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is rare and an idiopathic disorder. The disease has been associated with drugs, infection, or irradiation, and its relationship with asthma remains unclear. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a case of a 49-year-old female patient after trastuzumab and radiation therapy for breast cancer. Two months after radiation treatment, the patient complained of productive cough, progressive breathlessness, occasional wheezing, and left pectoralgia. DIAGNOSES: Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed infiltrates in lungs. Without evidence of infection, marked increased eosinophils in a transbronchial biopsy performed from the left upper lobe confirmed the diagnosis of CEP after trastuzumab and radiation therapy. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was started with oral prednisone at 0.5 mg/kg/day. OUTCOMES: A CT scan of the chest obtained 2 weeks after steroid treatment showed diminishment of the lesions, and at the 6-month follow-up, the patient had no complaints of discomfort with no relapse of pulmonary lesions. LESSONS: Physicians should consider CEP as a diagnosis in patients who have had previous exposure to trastuzumab and radiation therapy, especially with a history of asthma. Timely diagnosis and treatment may benefit these patients.

The management of cicatricial ectropion resulting from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors is unclear. We describe two cases of bilateral cicatricial ectropion following the use of an EGFR inhibitor who were treated with oral doxycycline, topical ophthalmic steroid and antibiotic ointment to the eyelids, and topical facial steroid cream with lubrication. The first case resolved with discontinuation of panitumumab infusions along with institution of the aforementioned regimen. However, it is unclear whether the resolution was from discontinuation of the infusions or from the instituted regimen. The second case resolved without a dose adjustment of cituximab. This case may provide support for the use of this regimen prior to discontinuation of the offending agent, as there was a successful outcome without alteration of the infusions. Additional cases are necessary to determine if this is a successful means of treating bilateral lower-lid cicatricial ectropion from EGFR inhibitors.

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate the hypothesis that patients using beta-blockers will develop hearing loss. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 125 patients completed the study. A total of 63 patients were on beta-blockers and 62 were not on beta-blockers. RESULTS: Carvedilol was significantly associated with hearing loss. Other beta-blockers including metoprolol and atenolol showed no association with hearing loss. Linear multiple regression analysis was run including variables of gender, age, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure/dilated cardiomyopathy, frusemide and carvedilol use as predictors for total hearing loss severity at all frequencies. Age and gender, as well as carvedilol, were found to be the only statistically significant predictors for hearing loss severity. CONCLUSION: Chronic use of carvedilol was associated with significant hearing loss. This may need to be taken into account when prescribing the drug. Further randomised controlled studies with baseline audiometric hearing tests before starting treatment, and periodic follow-up tests, would provide a better assessment of the effect of carvedilol on hearing.
28318833	2018/9/25	Simvastatin	Diplopia	Journal Article	0	1	0	0	0	Bibliometric analysis of the scientific production as regards statin use for ophthalmological symptoms of myasthenia gravis.	INTRODUCTION: The first symptoms of myasthenia gravis (MG) usually involve weakness of the ocular muscles, making it relevant that ophthalmologists have updated information on studies as regards its relationship with the consumption of drugs, such as statins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Scopus database and by a search strategy in the selection of documents containing descriptors related to statins in the <<Title>> (<<TI>>) field and the descriptors <<ophthalm *', <<myast *', <<visual *' in other fields of the document (period 1986-2015). RESULTS: The results showed that, while the number of scientific publications on ocular effects of statins has grown lineally (n=838; y=2.267x-4507.1; r=0.7221; time of duplication: 4.66 years, and rate of annual growth: 50.06%), the specific publications about MG have experienced an exponential growth (n=38; y=2E-262e(0.3001x); r=0.3892; time of duplication: 2.95 years, and rate of annual growth: 46.25%) without reaching the saturation postulated in Price theory of the expansion of the scientific literature. The majority of publications relating to MG are reports of cases linked to a worsening of the MG symptoms, and simvastatin and atorvastatin are the agents mentioned in most of the publications. CONCLUSIONS: These results should enable ophthalmologists to expand their knowledge concerning the evolution of studies on statins and MG, pointing out the relevance of such causal relationships.

BACKGROUND: This multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study evaluated therapeutic equivalence, steady-state pharmacokinetics, and safety of a novel abiraterone acetate fine particle formulation (AAFP) 500mg plus methylprednisolone vs. the originator AA (OAA) 1000mg plus prednisone in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The primary endpoint was a comparison of average of serum testosterone levels on treatment days 9 and 10 between groups. METHODS: Men with progressive mCRPC, receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist therapy, and with a serum testosterone level of <50ng/dl were randomized 1:1 to either AAFP 500mg daily plus 4mg methylprednisolone orally twice daily (BID), or OAA 1000mg daily plus 5mg prednisone BID for 84 days. Serum testosterone, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), steady-state (trough) abiraterone pharmacokinetics, and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were enrolled (n = 24, AAFP; n = 29, OAA). Mean age was 75.1 years and 54.7% had Gleason>7. Over 90% of patients in each group achieved absolute testosterone levels of </=1ng/dl during the study. The averaged absolute testosterone levels </=0.1ng/dl were achieved in 25% of AAFP-treated patients and 17% of OAA-treated patients. A PSA-50 response was observed in>65% of patients in both groups on days 28, 56, and 84 (P = NS, all timepoints). Days 9 and 10 averaged rounded-up least squares (LS) mean (SE) serum testosterone levels were comparable (1.05ng/dl [0.04], AAFP; 1.02ng/dl [0.03], OAA; P = 0.4703 for LS mean difference). The geometric mean ratio between groups was 1.021 (90% CI: 0.965-1.081); the 90% CI fell within 80.0% to 125.0% equivalence limits. The LS mean differences in abiraterone trough plasma concentrations were not statistically significant at any visit. Adverse event frequency was comparable between arms (75.0%, AAFP; 82.8%, OAA). Musculoskeletal events were more common among OAA-treated patients (37.9% vs. 12.5%). CONCLUSION: Therapeutic equivalence between AAFP 500mg daily and OAA 1000mg daily based on serum testosterone levels was confirmed in mCRPC patients. Both agents led to similar PSA-50 response rates. Abiraterone trough levels were similar between treatments. No new safety concerns were observed.

BACKGROUND: Health effects of air pollution on diabetes have been scarcely studied in developing countries. We aimed to explore the associations of long-term exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants with diabetes prevalence and glucose-homoeostasis markers in China. METHODS: Between April 1 and Dec 31, 2009, we recruited a total of 15 477 participants aged 18-74 years using a random number generator and a four-staged, stratified and cluster sampling strategy from a large cross-sectional study (the 33 Communities Chinese Health Study) from three cities in Liaoning province, northeastern China. Fasting and 2 h insulin and glucose concentrations and the homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index and beta-cell function were used as glucose-homoeostasis markers. Diabetes was defined according to the American Diabetes Association's recommendations. We calculated exposure to air pollutants using data from monitoring stations (PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mum or less [PM(10)], sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone) and a spatial statistical model (PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 1 mum or less [PM(1)] and 2.5 mum or less [PM(2.5)]). We used two-level logistic regression and linear regression analyses to assess associations between exposure and outcomes, controlling for confounders. FINDINGS: All the studied pollutants were significantly associated with increased diabetes prevalence (eg, the adjusted odds ratios associated with an increase in IQR for PM(1), PM(2.5), and PM(10) were 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.22; 1.14, 1.03-1.25; and 1.20, 1.12-1.28, respectively). These air pollutants were also associated with higher concentrations of fasting glucose (0.04-0.09 mmol/L), 2 h glucose (0.10-0.19 mmol/L), and 2 h insulin (0.70-2.74 muU/L). No association was observed for the remaining biomarkers. Stratified analyses indicated greater effects on the individuals who were younger (<50 years) or overweight or obese. INTERPRETATION: Long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with increased risk of diabetes in a Chinese population, particularly in individuals who were younger or overweight or obese.

PURPOSE: Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) presents uncommonly with cranial nerve involvement with ophthalmological implications. METHODS: We report the case of a 37year-old man who developed CIDP which manifested as progressive and relapsing bilateral facial nerve palsy with lagophthalmos and exposure keratopathy, in the setting of treatment of Crohn's disease with the anti-TNF-alpha agent adalimumab. RESULTS: Symptoms gradually improved over the course of several months following withdrawal of adalimumab and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and oral prednisolone. CONCLUSION: Bilateral facial nerve involvement occurs uncommonly as a feature of CIDP in its classic form. The prognosis is good for recovery of facial nerve function with discontinuation of anti-TNF-alpha therapy and concurrent use of steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin in this case.

BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether ketamine administered via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) provides adequate analgesia while reducing opioid consumption in the traumatically injured patient. Differences in opioid consumption, pain scores, and adverse effects between ketamine and hydromorphone PCA were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, single-center, double-blinded, randomized, pilot trial conducted from 2014 to 2016 at a level 1 trauma center. Nonintubated trauma patients in intensive care, who were receiving PCA, were randomized to ketamine or hydromorphone PCA plus opioid analgesics for breakthrough pain. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were randomized. There was no difference in median daily breakthrough opioid use (10 [0.63-19.38] mg versus 10 [4.38-22.5] mg, P = 0.55). Subjects in the ketamine group had lower median cumulative opioid use on therapy day 1 than the hydromorphone group (4.6 [2.5-15] mg versus 41.8 [31.8-50] mg, P < 0.001), as well as in the first 48 h (10 [3.3-15] mg versus 48.5 [32.1-67.5] mg, P < 0.001) and first 72 h (10 [4.2-15] mg versus 42.5 [31.7-65.2] mg, P < 0.001) of therapy. Daily oxygen supplementation requirements were lower in the ketamine group (0.5 [0-1.5] L/min versus 2 [0.5-3] L/min, P = 0.020). Hallucinations occurred more frequently in the ketamine group (40% versus 0%, P = 0.090). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine PCA led to lower cumulative opioid consumption and lower oxygen supplementation requirements, though hallucinations occurred more frequently with use of ketamine. Additional studies are needed to investigate the tolerability of ketamine as an alternative to traditional opioid-based PCA.
29250741	2019/2/26	Everolimus	Mood Disorders	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Everolimus induced mood changes in breast cancer patients: a case-control study.	Introduction The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a critical role in cancer cell growth, proliferation and angiogenesis, but also in brain homeostasis and the pathophysiology of mood disorders. The impact of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus on the mood of breast cancer patients is unknown. Materials and methods Consecutive, post-menopausal metastatic breast cancer patients receiving hormone therapy +/- everolimus were prospectively followed-up using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the MADRS (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale) questionnaires. Results Post hoc tests comparing everolimus + hormonotherapy to hormonotherapy alone demonstrated a significant effect of everolimus after 6 weeks of treatment on BDI scores (t(1,38) = -2.0716, p < 0.05), and after 3 weeks (t(1,38) = -3.9165, p < 0.001) and 6 weeks of treatment (t(1,38) = -2.0373, p < 0.05) on MADRS scores. Analysis within each treatment group showed that the effect of time since treatment initiation on BDI and MADRS scores was specifically observed in the everolimus + hormonotherapy group (F(2,34) = 11.875, p < 0.001 and F(2,34) = 7.820, p < 0.01 respectively), but not in the hormonotherapy alone group (F(2,34) = 1.671, p > 0.2 and F(2,34) = 0.830, p > 0.2 respectively). Conclusions The mTOR inhibitor everolimus induces significant mood alterations in breast cancer patients. The evaluation of psychiatric symptoms is not only mandatory in the context of phase 1, dose-finding studies of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, but is also clinically relevant in daily practice.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a disorder characterized by motor symptoms such as weakness in both proximal and distal muscles with globally diminished or absent reflexes. Insulin neuritis is referred as an acute pain in the extremities, due to the damage of peripheral nerves affecting mainly small fibers, in diabetic patients treated with insulin who achieved rapid glycemic control. Pain is unusual in classic CIDP. We report the case of a 54-year-old female patient with type II diabetes mellitus, and a recent onset of insulin therapy, who presented at the emergency room with a 2-month history of weakness and hyperalgesia of extremities. Physical examination showed marked pain and proximal and distal allodynia in the 4 limbs, with reduced muscle strength of the proximal muscles and patellar and achillear areflexia. Electrophysiological study showed sensory and motor polyneuropathy with a demyelinating predominance. Treatment with recombinant human immunoglobin was started, and the patient presented a total remission of the condition. Complementary studies confirmed weak serum positivity of GM1, GD1a, GD1b and anti-asialo GM1. Prior to hospital discharge, results of positive serum VDRL and FTA-Abs were received. VDRL in cerebrospinal fluid was negative, so neurosyphilis was ruled out, and treatment with benzathine penicillin was indicated.

BACKGROUND: Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is a rare complication of chemotherapy, characterized by multiple gas accumulations within the bowel wall. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old woman with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma was admitted to our hospital because of reduced consciousness. She was diagnosed as having leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LM) using lumbar puncture. Because she could not swallow a tablet, erlotinib was administered via a feeding tube. Her state of consciousness gradually improved, but she experienced diarrhea several times a day. After 3 weeks of erlotinib therapy, PI occurred. Erlotinib was discontinued and PI was resolved after treatment with conservative therapies. Erlotinib was re-administrated and PI occurred again. After improvement of erlotinib-induced PI, gefitinib was administered by a feeding tube and the patient did not experience PI or diarrhea. The patient survived 8 months from the diagnosis of LM. CONCLUSION: PI is one of the side effects of erlotinib, and consecutive therapies are useful for the treatment of PI. In this patient, gefitinib was successfully administered after erlotinib-induced PI.

BACKGROUND Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are the mainstay immunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplantation. Although they provide excellent allograft and patient outcomes, adverse effects are frequently encountered. Calcineurin inhibitor-induced pain syndrome (CIPS) is a rare adverse effect of CNI. Previous case reports with CIPS diagnosis involved incapacitating pain in the lower extremities. CASE REPORT In this article, we report the first case of CIPS with severe back pain as the presenting symptom, which was correlated with a high tacrolimus trough concentration due to a drug interaction with clotrimazole troche. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine showed bone marrow edema, which is consistent with previous case reports. The patient's symptoms resolved within 3 weeks of the onset of pain. Treatments were symptomatic care and lowering the tacrolimus trough concentration. Pain was improved significantly with pregabalin but not with nifedipine. CONCLUSIONS We reviewed the literature of kidney transplant cohorts with CIPS to ascertain prevalence, pain characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Apart from our case, all patients experienced lower extremities pain and were pain-free during the follow-up period, without any residual abnormalities. CIPS is a benign but adverse effect of CNI. Counselling patients about the disease's natural history and supportive care remain the best treatment.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of porphyria: it is characterized by blistering lesions, erosions and crusts on the back of the hands, associated with photosensitivity and facial hypertrichosis. It is produced by acquired or hereditary deficiency of the enzyme UROD, fifth enzyme in the chain of production of the Heme group. This causes accumulation of porphyrins in the liver, which are subsequently mobilized to the skin, where lesions are generated by photosensitivity. This deficiency can be exacerbated by multiple causes. We report a 51-year-old female presenting with the characteristic dermal lesions described above, which disappeared when she discontinued her hormone replacement therapy with estradiol and dydrogesterone. Urinary and blood uroporphyrin and hexacarboxyl porphyrins were elevated and plasma ferritin was 479 ng/ml. Hormone replacement therapy was discontinued and phlebotomies were attempted but not tolerated by the patient. The dermic lesions have not relapsed.

Hair cells in the cochlea can be damaged by various causes. Damaged hair cells can lead to additional destruction of parts of the auditory afferent pathway sequentially, which is called secondary degeneration. Recently, researches regarding cochlear implants have been actively carried out for clinical purposes; secondary degeneration in animals is a much more practical model for identifying the prognosis of cochlear implants. However, an appropriate model for this research is not established yet. Thus, we developed a secondary degeneration model using an ototoxic drug. 35 gerbils were separated into four different groups and kanamycin was applied via various approaches. ABR was measured several times after drug administration. SGCs were also counted to identify any secondary degeneration. The results showed that outer and inner HCs were damaged in all kanamycin-treated groups. Twelve weeks after kanamycin treatment, the round window membrane injection group showed severe subject differences in hair cells and SGC damage, whereas the gelfoam group showed consistent and severe damage in hair cells and SGCs. In this study, we successfully induced secondary degeneration in hair cells in a gerbil model. This model can be used for various purposes in the hearing research area either for treatment or for preservation.

Lanthanum carbonate is a phosphate binder that is used to reduce serum phosphate levels in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Lanthanum forms insoluble lanthanum phosphate complexes that are supposed to pass through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract unabsorbed. Phosphate binders have been reported to deposit in the GI tract and can cause mucosal injury. There are few case reports of GI bleeding associated with phosphate binder deposits. This case report presents a patient with iron deficiency anaemia secondary to biopsy-proven lanthanum deposits in the upper GI tract. There were no overt signs of active GI bleeding. Patient's anaemia improved with discontinuation of the phosphate binder. Lanthanum could be a hidden cause of resistant anaemia among patients with ESRD through asymptomatic GI blood loss.

Nonporous silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) are promising drug carrier platforms for intraocular drug delivery. In this study, we investigated the safety of three different sizes of SiNPs (50, 100, and 150 nm) in a human corneal endothelial cell (HCEC) line, B4G12. The HCECs were exposed to different concentrations (0, 25, 50, and 100 microg/ml) of three sizes of SiNPs for up to 48 h. Cellular viability, autophagy, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation were evaluated. Intracellular distribution of the SiNPs was evaluated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM revealed that the SiNPs were up-taken by the HCECs inside cytoplasmic vacuoles. No mitochondrial structural damage was observed. Both cellular viability and LDH level remained unchanged with up to 100 microg/mL of SiNP treatment. Autophagy showed a significant dose-dependent activation with 50, 100, and 150 nm SiNPs. However, the mTOR activation remained unchanged. Human corneal tissue culture with 100 microg/ml concentrations of SiNPs for 72 h revealed no significant endothelial toxicity. In vivo corneal safety of the SiNPs (0.05 ml intracameral injection, 200 mg/ml concentration) was also verified in rabbit models. These findings suggested that 50, 100, and 150 nm SiNPs did not induce acute significant cytotoxicity in corneal endothelial cells at concentrations up to 100 microg/mL. However, long-term toxicity of SiNPs remains unknown.

PURPOSE: Breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapies face risks of relapse, increased rates of cardiovascular events, and toxicities of therapy such as aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS). C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for inflammation, is associated with breast cancer outcomes. We evaluated whether the olive-derived polyphenol hydroxytyrosol combined with omega-3 fatty acids and curcumin would reduce CRP and musculoskeletal symptoms in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant hormonal therapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm, clinical trial enrolled post-menopausal breast cancer patients (n = 45) with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) taking predominantly aromatase inhibitors to receive a combination of hydroxytyrosol, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin for 1 month. CRP, other inflammation-associated cytokines, and pain scores on the Brief Pain Inventory were measured before therapy, at the end of therapy and 1 month after completion of therapy. RESULTS: CRP levels declined during the therapy [from 8.2 +/- 6.4 mg/L at baseline to 5.3 +/- 3.2 mg/L (p = 0.014) at 30 days of treatment], and remained decreased during the additional 1 month off therapy. Subjects with the highest baseline CRP levels had the greatest decrease with the therapy. Pain scores also decreased during the therapy. There were no significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of hydroxytyrosol, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin reduced inflammation as indicated by a reduction in CRP and reduced pain in patients with aromatase-induced musculoskeletal symptoms. Longer studies comparing this combination to other anti-inflammatories in larger groups of patients with clinical outcome endpoints are warranted.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Immune checkpoint therapy has grown in prominence in the last few decades and is being increasingly utilized in treatment of advanced cancers. Although information on toxicities of these drugs is forthcoming, not much is known regarding the toxicity profile of these drugs from a sexual function standpoint. We undertook the current review to appraise the literature for endocrine/sexual side effects of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Our review included 32 articles and focused primarily on the programmed death (PD) pathway. We found that endocrine side effects after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy are relatively rare, with hypothyroidism (range < 1 to 40%) and hypophysitis (range < 1 to 10%) being the two most common. None of the studies specifically commented on the infertility or sexual side effects of these drugs. However, two studies evaluating biochemical profiles of patients undergoing therapy with ipilimumab (a CTLA-4 inhibitor) or combination therapy (CTLA-4 + PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) noted that about < 1 to ~ 60% of the patients developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. None of the studies provided information regarding clinically meaningful sexual health endpoints such as libido, erectile function assessments, or sexual function-related quality of life. Endocrine side effects, although uncommon, are important and unique side effects of immune checkpoint therapy because they are often complex and can be life threatening. While side effects on sexual health may not be life threatening, they are lifestyle limiting. Thus, long-term follow-up, post-marketing surveillance, and future studies will need to elucidate the true rates of endocrine/sexual side effects and the mechanisms underlying them. This will aid in better counseling of the patients, as more of them undergo these novel immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

While side effects on sexual health may not be life threatening, they are lifestyle limiting. Thus, long-term follow-up, post-marketing surveillance, and future studies will need to elucidate the true rates of endocrine/sexual side effects and the mechanisms underlying them. This will aid in better counseling of the patients, as more of them undergo these novel immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Immune checkpoint therapy has grown in prominence in the last few decades and is being increasingly utilized in treatment of advanced cancers. Although information on toxicities of these drugs is forthcoming, not much is known regarding the toxicity profile of these drugs from a sexual function standpoint. We undertook the current review to appraise the literature for endocrine/sexual side effects of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Our review included 32 articles and focused primarily on the programmed death (PD) pathway. We found that endocrine side effects after anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy are relatively rare, with hypothyroidism (range < 1 to 40%) and hypophysitis (range < 1 to 10%) being the two most common. None of the studies specifically commented on the infertility or sexual side effects of these drugs. However, two studies evaluating biochemical profiles of patients undergoing therapy with ipilimumab (a CTLA-4 inhibitor) or combination therapy (CTLA-4 + PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors) noted that about < 1 to ~ 60% of the patients developed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. None of the studies provided information regarding clinically meaningful sexual health endpoints such as libido, erectile function assessments, or sexual function-related quality of life. Endocrine side effects, although uncommon, are important and unique side effects of immune checkpoint therapy because they are often complex and can be life threatening. While side effects on sexual health may not be life threatening, they are lifestyle limiting. Thus, long-term follow-up, post-marketing surveillance, and future studies will need to elucidate the true rates of endocrine/sexual side effects and the mechanisms underlying them. This will aid in better counseling of the patients, as more of them undergo these novel immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
28796148	2019/6/7	Chlorhexidine	Eye Pain	Journal Article	1	0	0	0	0	PAIN AND ANTISEPSIS AFTER OCULAR ADMINISTRATION OF POVIDONE-IODINE VERSUS CHLORHEXIDINE.	PURPOSE: To investigate ocular bacterial count before and after antisepsis with aqueous chlorhexidine (AC) or povidone-iodine (PI) and to assess discomfort with each agent. METHODS: Bacterial swabs were taken from participants' eyes before and after antisepsis. These underwent microscopy, culture, and sensitivity testing. Aqueous chlorhexidine drops were administered to left eyes and PI to right eyes. Participants rated their pain (scale 0-10) for each eye but were blinded to the type of drop. RESULTS: There were 20 participants (17 women, 3 men), and the mean age was 43 years. Pain scores were significantly higher in right (PI) than in left (AC) eyes (mean 7 vs. mean 2, P < 0.001). No abnormalities were detected on specimen microscopy and gram staining. Seven preantisepsis swabs (three left and four right) grew bacteria in culture. Two postantisepsis swabs grew bacteria in primary culture plate (1 after AC and 1 after PI). For an additional one post-PI swab, bacteria were detected in enrichment broth only. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of AC and PI are similar, and patient discomfort is lower with AC. Aqueous chlorhexidine is a good alternative to PI for antisepsis before intravitreal injection.

30590197	2019/2/16	Olanzapine	Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease	Journal Article	0	1	0	0	0	Chronic treatment with the modified Longdan Xiegan Tang attenuates olanzapine-induced fatty liver in rats by regulating hepatic de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation-associated gene expression mediated by SREBP-1c, PPAR-alpha and AMPK-alpha.	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The modified Longdan Xiegan Tang (mLXT) has been used clinically for various neuropsychiatric disorders and liver diseases. The use of antipsychotics is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effect and underlying mechanisms of mLXT on antipsychotic-induced fatty liver. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The representative active components in the formula were identified and quantified by a HPLC method. Fatty liver in male rats was induced by olanzapine (5 mg/kg) (p.o., x 8 weeks), and the rats were co-treated with mLXT extract (50 and 500 mg/kg). Blood and liver variables were determined enzymatically or histologically. Gene/protein expression was analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Treatment of rats with mLXT decreased olanzapine-induced increases in hepatic triglyceride content, cell vacuolar degeneration and Oil Red O-stained area, accompanied by suppression of olanzapine-stimulated hepatic mRNA and/or protein overexpression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, and its downstream lipogenic enzymes for de novo lipogenesis. Besides, mLXT also activated hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and its target genes associated with fatty acid beta-oxidation, phosphorylated Thr(172) in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-alpha (the upstream enzyme of SREBP-1c and PPAR-alpha), and its ratio to total AMPK-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that chronic treatment with mLXT ameliorates olanzapine-induced fatty liver by regulating hepatic de novo lipogenesis- and fatty acid beta-oxidation-associated gene expression mediated by SREBP-1c and PPAR-alpha, respectively, through activation of AMPK-alpha. Our findings provide the evidence that supports clinical use of the formula for antipsychotic medication-induced fatty liver.
29986042	2019/8/31	Ezetimibe	Depressive Disorder	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Risk of Neuropsychiatric Adverse Effects of Lipid-Lowering Drugs: A Mendelian Randomization Study.	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have highlighted the possible risk of neuropsychiatric adverse effects during treatment with lipid-lowering medications. However, there are still controversies that require a novel genetic-based approach to verify whether the impact of lipid-lowering drug treatment results in neuropsychiatric troubles including insomnia, depression, and neuroticism. Thus, we applied Mendelian randomization to assess any potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects of conventional lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and ezetimibe. METHODS: A 2-sample Mendelian randomization study was conducted based on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies for lipids, insomnia, depression, and neuroticism. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in or near drug target genes of HMGCR, PCSK9, and NPC1L1 were used as proxies for statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe therapy, respectively. To assess the validity of the genetic risk score, their associations with coronary artery disease were used as a positive control. RESULTS: The Mendelian randomization analysis showed a statistically significant (P <.004) increased risk of depression after correcting for multiple testing with both statins (odds ratio=1.15, 95% CI: 1.04-1.19) and PCSK9 inhibitor treatment (odds ratio =1.19, 95%CI: 1.1-1.29). The risk of neuroticism was slightly reduced with statin therapy (odds ratio=0.9, 95%CI: 0.83-0.97). No significant adverse effects were associated with ezetimibe treatment. As expected, the 3 medications significantly reduced the risk of coronary artery disease. CONCLUSION: Using a genetic-based approach, this study showed an increased risk of depression during statin and PCSK9 inhibitor therapy while their association with insomnia risk was not significant.

Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody used for the management of various solid malignancies including colorectal, lung, brain, renal, and ovarian cancers as well as age-related macular degeneration of the eye. It is a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor which exhibits its action by blocking the growth of blood vessels in cancerous tissue. Common side effects include hypertension, fatigue, headaches, and increased risk of infections. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a serious side effect associated with bevacizumab due to its anti-angiogenic effect. It encompasses the clinical triad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure, without any association with Shiga toxins. Eculizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor used in the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. Herein, we present three cases of bevacizumab-induced atypical hemolytic syndrome treated successfully with eculizumab.

Crizotinib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2011 for the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)- or ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Since then, the number of indicated uses for crizotinib has substantially increased. However, the administration of crizotinib can be associated with various adverse events. It is important that clinicians identify adverse cutaneous manifestations of crizotinib and are aware of their outcomes and treatments to avoid unnecessarily discontinuing a potentially life-saving medication. We describe a case of lichenoid drug eruption (LDE) that appeared 4 weeks after initiation of treatment with crizotinib in a 61-year-old man with ALK-positive metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.

PURPOSE: To report a case of acute retinal necrosis in a patient on anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 47-year-old man with psoriasis presented with blurred vision and floaters in the left eye 4 days after receiving his fourth dose of adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist. He was diagnosed with acute retinal necrosis and was treated with intravenous acyclovir as well as prophylactic laser barricade. Seven years later, he is 20/20 with no history of a retinal detachment. CONCLUSION: Physicians prescribing tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist immunosuppressive therapy should be aware of the potential of developing acute retinal necrosis.

A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with melanoma. After receiving 13 infusions of nivolumab, he had fulminant myocarditis. The myocardial biopsy specimen revealed extensive lymphocytic infiltration, interstitial edema, and myocardial necrosis, with predominant CD4+, CD8+, CD20-, and programmed death-1- markers. Programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) was predominantly expressed on the surface of the damaged myocardium. Although it is reported that myocarditis induced by the human anti-programmed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab therapy rarely occurred at > 2 months use in clinical trials, this case showed that even if at a late phase, long-term use of immune checkpoint inhibitors might to lead immune-related adverse events including myocarditis.

A 51-year-old man with chronic myeloid leukemia undergoing treatment with dasatinib received colonoscopy for a positive fecal occult blood test. Colonoscopy revealed more than 100 erythematous, multilobulated polyps with mucoid discharge. Endoscopic mucosal resection was performed for diagnosis, and the histological analysis of polyps showed hyperplastic glands and proliferative smooth muscle cells. Our findings suggested that the polyposis was caused by inflammation triggered due to the adverse effects associated with dasatinib. The patient discontinued dasatinib;the follow-up colonoscopy performed four months later revealed significantly improved polypoid lesions in the colon. The erythematous heads of the polyps and mucoid discharge disappeared. The cessation of dasatinib seemed to contribute to the improvement of inflammatory reactive polyposis;therefore, we inferred that the polyposis was caused by dasatinib in the present case.

Mesalamine, or 5-aminosalicylic acid, is a frequently used medication for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We report the case of a 40-year-old woman recently diagnosed with IBD and started on mesalamine, who presented with new onset tender skin lesions 3 days following medication administration. One day following the onset of skin lesions, the patient developed acute chest pain, shortness of breath, ECG changes, troponemia, C-reactive protein elevation and pericardial enhancement on cardiac MRI consistent with myopericarditis. Subsequent skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome. On cessation of the drug, both the skin lesions and the cardiac symptoms resolved in combination with anti-inflammatory therapy. While mesalamine has been previously associated with myocarditis and pericarditis, to our knowledge this is the first case of coexisting Sweet's syndrome with myopericarditis in the context of mesalamine therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancer which may cause central nervous system toxicity, namely cerebellar dysfunction. CASE REPORT: We describe a 77-year-old man undergoing adjuvant treatment of colon cancer with capecitabine and oxaliplatin who presented with acute cerebellar ataxia and encephalopathy that progressed to coma. Diagnosis of toxic encephalopathy was made after the exclusion of alternative causes of neurological dysfunction and complete resolution of clinical findings with permanent discontinuation of chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: When patients with cancer develop symptoms and signs of central nervous dysfunction, metabolic and infectious causes plus tumor involvement of central nervous system must be sought. However, chemotherapy may also cause toxicity to the central nervous system. Capecitabine is no exception, although cerebellar dysfunction is rarely reported. CONCLUSION: Although rare, capecitabine-induced encephalopathy may be severe and physicians should be aware of this possible side effect.

The objectives were to define a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of bendamustine, determine safety and toxicity, assess efficacy, and evaluate impact on stem cell collection. Forty-eight patients were treated of which 71% had refractory disease. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The recommended phase II dose of bendamustine was 120 mg/m(2) per day on days 1 and 2. Response rates were 85% (70% complete response, CR) in HL, and 65% (40% CR) in DLBCL. Stem cell collection was successful in 30 of 32 patients. The most common non-haematological toxicities >/=grade 3 were febrile neutropenia (8%) and dehydration (8%). The T(R)EC regimen safely yields high response rates, successfully mobilizes peripheral blood stem cells and compares favourably to RICE, offering an effective outpatient treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and HL.

Opioid misuse is at historically high levels in the United States, with inhalation (ie, smoking and vaping) being one of the most common routes of consumption. We developed and validated a novel preclinical model of opioid self-administration by inhalation that does not require surgery and reliably produces somatic and motivational signs of dependence. Rats were trained to perform an operant response (nosepoke) to receive 10 s of vaporized sufentanil, a potent opioid, in 2 h daily sessions. Rats readily and concentration-dependently self-administered vaporized sufentanil. Rats exhibited a significant increase in responding for sufentanil when given the preferential mu-opioid receptor inverse agonist naloxone, suggesting the participation of mu-opioid receptors in the reinforcing properties of sufentanil vapor. Serum sufentanil concentrations significantly correlated with the number of sufentanil vapor deliveries. Rats that were given long access (LgA; 12 h/day) but not short access (ShA; 1 h/day) to vaporized sufentanil escalated their drug intake over time and exhibited both naloxone-precipitated somatic signs of opioid withdrawal and spontaneous withdrawal-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. After 6 months of forced drug abstinence, LgA rats returned to pre-escalation baseline levels of responding for sufentanil and mechanical sensitivity. Upon subsequent re-escalation (ie, after the return to extended access to sufentanil vapor), LgA rats again developed naloxone-precipitated somatic signs of withdrawal and spontaneous withdrawal-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. These findings demonstrate that the operant sufentanil vapor self-administration model has both face and construct validity and therefore will be useful for investigating the neurobiological basis of opioid addiction.
30154038	2019/5/22	Rabeprazole	Hyponatremia	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Associations of proton pump inhibitors and hospitalization due to hyponatremia: A population-based case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Small observational studies and case reports have indicated that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may cause hyponatremia. Whether there is a difference between the individual PPIs is yet unknown. Since PPIs are one of the most commonly prescribed groups of drugs, even a rare adverse reaction may have large implications. The objective was to study the association between PPIs and hospitalization due to hyponatremia. METHODS: This register-based case-control study was based on the general Swedish population. Patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of hyponatremia (n = 14,359) were compared to matched controls (n = 57,383). The association between newly initiated (</=90 days) and ongoing PPI use was explored using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for concomitant drugs, medical conditions, previous hospitalizations and socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Adjusted ORs (95%CI) for hospitalization due to hyponatremia, compared to controls, were for newly initiated: omeprazole 2.67 (2.37-3.01); pantoprazole 2.06 (1.32-3.19); lansoprazole 1.19 (0.72-1.94); esomeprazole 2.89 (2.21-3.79) and any PPI 2.78 (2.48-3.11). Only one individual had been newly initiated on rabeprazole and had been hospitalized due to hyponatremia. Adjusted ORs (95%CI) for individuals with ongoing treatment were for: omeprazole 1.04 (0.97-1.11); pantoprazole 0.81 (0.62-1.05); lansoprazole 0.90 (0.70-1.15); rabeprazole 3.34 (0.84-11.43); esomeprazole 1.12 (0.94-1.33) and any PPI 1.04 (0.98-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of lansoprazole, this study suggests an association between any newly initiated PPI-treatment and hospitalization due to hyponatremia. Ongoing PPI use was not associated with an increased risk.

Eosinophilic pleural effusions (EPE) account for 5%-8% of all exudative pleural effusions. A pleural effusion is defined as eosinophilic if it contains 10% or more eosinophils. We present the case of a 70-year-old man with EPE, blood eosinophilia and pericardial effusion due to dabigatran, a novel anti-thrombin agent.
30786894	2019/4/24	Opium	Long QT Syndrome	Journal Article_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	1	1	0	0	0	Drug-induced prolonged corrected QT interval in patients with methadone and opium overdose.	BACKGROUND: Iran is a country with the highest rate of opioid addiction in the world. The most commonly used opioid in Iran is opium, and methadone is in second place. The trend of drug use has changed from opium to methadone from 2006 to 2011. Presence of a large number of addicted people and methadone maintenance therapy clinics make methadone readily available in Iran. Therefore, evaluation of the epidemiological characteristic of methadone toxicity and its effects on the heart is essential. METHODS: In This cross-sectional, retrospective, descriptive, analytical study all patients with methadone or opium toxicity who had been admitted to Vasei hospital, Sabzevar, Iran, during the years 2015 and 2016 were included, and their records were evaluated. Demographic data, addiction history, underlying diseases, and the outcome of admission were recorded. Then, corrected QT interval (QTc) of the first ECG of the patients after admission was evaluated. RESULTS: The Majority of toxicities occurred in those above 30 years of age (71.4%), who lived in cities (62.8%), and were married (69.2%). A positive history of addiction was considerably higher in the opium group (72.3% versus 43.3%). There was no significant difference regarding QTc prolongation between patients with methadone and opium toxicity (p = 0.3). CONCLUSION: QTc prolongation is one of the adverse effects of methadone or opium overdose. It seems that significant QTc prolongation is not uncommon among patients with opium overdose.

PURPOSE: To report a case of afatinib-related bilateral ulcerative keratitis. METHODS: An 85-year-old female patient on treatment with afatinib for non-small-cell lung carcinoma presented with progressive redness, pain, and decreased vision in both eyes. Four weeks before the onset of symptoms, afatinib therapy had been commenced at a dose of 40 mg, once daily. Clinical examination, OCT imaging, photographs, and corneal scrapes were completed at presentation. Afatinib was discontinued. Topical and oral therapy were commenced to treat ulcerative keratitis with close monitoring for signs of progression or corneal perforation. RESULTS: Significant stromal thinning was detected in the inferior cornea of both eyes with an overlying epithelial defect and no infiltrate. No organisms were identified from the corneal scrapes. The patient responded well to treatment, and her vision returned to baseline 4 months after presentation. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature that reports afatinib-related ulcerative keratitis. Careful monitoring for signs of ocular adverse events is recommended during treatment with afatinib for non-small-cell lung carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Bimatoprost has known adnexal activity and was observed to increase nail growth at two clinical centers. OBJECTIVES: In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study, we examine the effect of bimatoprost (Lumigan 0.01%), applied bid to the proximal nail fold on nail growth, nail brittleness, and intraocular pressure. METHODS: Bimatoprost drops were placed on the proximal nail folds of 45 subjects on one hand (medication group) and vehicle drops to the other hand (control group). Baseline and final nail growth measurements, Goldmann applanation tensions of both eyes, and photos at 30 days were performed. Nail brittleness was subjectively graded. RESULTS: For the 38 subjects completing the study, the final mean nail growth of the hands, the net individual nail growth of the digits (excluding chipped nails), nail brittleness, and eye pressure readings were NS at P<.05. Photos revealed no increased hirsutism, but one subject with increased skin pigmentation. The drops were well tolerated without adverse effects. Nail chipping was a limitation of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the negative results in this pilot study on nail growth and brittleness, further studies with higher bimatoprost concentration (0.03%) are warranted. We recommend monitoring nail growth by etching or marking the nail rather than measuring the full nail length due to our chipped nail findings.

Introduction Advances in systemic chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy have extended and improved the quality of life of patients with cancer. However, the central nervous system is very susceptible to complications of systemic cancer and its treatment. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare clinical and neuroradiologic entity which has garnered increasing recognition in the past two decades. Cancer patients are generally treated with cytotoxic agents, immunotherapy, molecular targeted therapies or glucosteroids which are more frequently associated with PRES. Case presentation A 59-year old female, known with a relapse of her lung adenocarcinoma, had been treated with 4 cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)). Six weeks after this combination chemotherapy and within 28 h after the administration of pemetrexed maintenance therapy, she developed a generalised epileptic insult. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed bilateral areas of increased signal intensity in the subcortical parietal and frontal white matter. She was treated with a broad spectrum antiseizure drug, levetiracetam 750 mg twice daily and strict control of blood pressure. Discussion Diagnosis of PRES should be considered in all patients with neurologic symptoms who are at risk to develop PRES. It is crucial to establish the diagnosis as soon as possible since there is no specific treatment of PRES other than correction of the underlying risk factors and preventing seizure recurrence. Administration of pemetrexed is a possible risk factor for the development of PRES.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and histological resolution of a case of an inexcisable conjunctival melanoma using topical interferon alpha 2b (INFalpha2b) in a patient with mitomycin C (MMC) intolerance. CASE REPORT: Conjunctival melanoma is a rare, but potentially sight- and life-threatening, tumour. In cases of multiple lesions, or when surgical excision is not possible, topical combination chemotherapy with MMC and INFalpha2b has been described as first line therapy. The case is presented of a 77 year-old woman with a multifocal conjunctival in situ melanoma, who was intolerant to initial treatment with MMC and was switched to long-term INFalpha2b therapy, with a good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: When topical MMC is given as chemotherapy treatment for primary acquired melanosis with atypia or in situ melanoma is not well tolerated, switching to INFalpha2b seems to be a good option. This approach could replace surgical management of pigmented tumours, especially the larger ones, with potential benefits that include less dependence on surgical margins. This report prompts a need for prospective studies designed to examine the role of INFalpha2b as primary treatment for heavily pigmented conjunctival tumours avoiding the ocular surface toxicity caused by MMC.
30301570	2019/5/10	Lamivudine	Mucositis	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and gynecomastia in an HIV-infected child: A case report.	BACKGROUND: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are antiretroviral drugs often used in the first-line treatment regimen of HIV1 infection worldwide. We report a case of successive gynecomastia and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) respectively induced by efavirenz and nevirapine in a single patient. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old boy, HIV1-infected since birth, was started on antiretroviral treatment (ART) in August 2015 and was taking a regimen comprising abacavir, lamivudine and efavirenz. In April 2016, when his weight reached 35kg, abacavir was replaced with tenofovir. Bilateral breast enlargement, previously hidden by the patient, was diagnosed two years after the start of ART. History-taking, physical examination and laboratory tests ruled out known causes of gynecomastia, and efavirenz was thus considered the most likely cause. This drug was then withdrawn and replaced with nevirapine in July 2017. Thirty-three days after the patient started nevirapine treatment, a skin rash appeared. Physical examination revealed erythematous macules and flaccid bullae with estimated skin detachment of 10%. There were also conjunctival, buccal and genital lesions. A diagnosis was made of SJS induced by nevirapine. Three months after withdrawal of efavirenz, breast size decreased by 3cm on the left breast and 2cm on the right breast; two months after the SJS, cutaneous sequelae alone persisted, such as diffuse hyperchromic macules. DISCUSSION: Recognition of gynecomastia as a side-effect of efavirenz is important to allow the condition to be treated while it is still potentially reversible. Moreover, when efavirenz is replaced, a protease inhibitor should be preferred to nevirapine.

30563719	2019/8/6	Fatty Acids, Omega-3	Puberty, Delayed	Journal Article_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	0	1	0	0	0	Chronic dietary changes in n-6/n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ratios cause developmental delay and reduce social interest in mice.	Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are one of the main cellular building blocks, and dietary changes in PUFA composition are proposed as a potential route to influence brain development. For example, initial studies indicated that there is a relation between blood omega-6(n-6)/omega-3(n-3) PUFA ratios and neurodevelopmental disease diagnosis. To study the consequences of dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio changes, we investigated the impact of a n-3 supplemented and n-3 deficient diet in developing BTBR T + Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) - a mouse inbred strain displaying Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)-like symptomatology - and control C57BL/6J mice. This study showed that pre- and postnatal changed dietary n-6/n-3 ratio intake has a major impact on blood and brain PUFA composition, and led to delayed physical development and puberty onset in both strains. The PUFA induced developmental delay did not impact adult cognitive performance, but resulted in reduced social interest, a main ASD behavioral feature. Thus, both chronic dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation and depletion may not be beneficial.

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to report a novel case of drug-induced angle-closure from aripiprazole (Abilify), an atypical antipsychotic, and propose a mechanism for this association. METHODS/RESULTS: We report a case of a 45-year-old white woman who presented in subacute angle closure 2 months after initiating aripiprazole 5 mg daily for depression. This patient reported no prior ocular history and had been on longstanding duloxetine (Cymbalta) 60 mg daily for over 10 years before starting aripiprazole. Examination at initial presentation revealed an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 16 mm Hg in the right eye and an elevated IOP of 44 mm Hg in the left eye. Gonioscopy demonstrated a plateau iris configuration in the right eye and angle closure with a plateau iris configuration in the left eye. She was started on IOP-lowering therapy and underwent a laser peripheral iridotomy. Despite recommendation to discontinue aripiprazole, duloxetine was discontinued; aripiprazole was maintained and later increased to 10 mg daily for worsening depression. Three months after the dosage increase, the patient was found to have an elevated IOP of 32 mm Hg and angle-closure with a plateau iris configuration in the left eye. Iridoplasty was performed in the left eye with subsequent opening of the angle and improvement in IOP. The second attack of angle-closure led to the discontinuation of aripiprazole and a corresponding widening of the angles in both eyes 1 week after cessation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to describe drug-induced angle-closure glaucoma associated with aripiprazole use. The mechanism of angle closure, we hypothesize, is from mydriasis and/or supraciliary effusion mediated by the serotoninergic effect on the iris and ciliary body complex. Treatment is preferably cessation of the medication. However, in cases where the medication is necessary for management of major depression, iridoplasty should be performed to reduce the risk of angle closure.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of severe multisystem illness, near death and permanent kidney failure in a woman with a history of anorexia nervosa-binge purge type due to abuse of prescription metformin, an approved oral diabetes medication obtained surreptitiously via the internet. METHOD: Psychiatric and medical records were reviewed from the medical care of this patient. A literature search was also performed on prescription medication abuse as a mode of purging. DISCUSSION: Metformin abuse in a patient with an eating disorder as a purging behavior is a rarely reported, albeit very dangerous entity. Clinicians treating eating disorders should increasingly be aware of the potential abuse of prescription medications, unapproved for weight loss but which have weight loss, as a reported side effect. This is particularly important as the ability to obtain prescription medications via the internet, without a prescription, becomes more ubiquitous.

BACKGROUND: While associated with obesity, the cause of the rapid rise in prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children, which is highest among Hispanics, is not well understood. Animal experiments have demonstrated that arsenic exposure contributes to liver injury. Our objective was to examine the association between arsenic exposure and NAFLD in humans and to determine if race/ethnicity modifies the association. METHODS: Urinary inorganic arsenic concentrations among those >/=12 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2005-2014 were used to assess the cross-sectional association with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, a marker of liver dysfunction. We excluded high alcohol consumers (>4-5 drinks/day; n = 939), positive hepatitis B or C (n = 2330), those missing body mass index (n = 100) and pregnant women (n = 629) for a final sample of 8518. Arsenic was measured using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and ALT was measured using standard methods. Sampling weights were used to obtain national estimates. Due to lack of normality, estimates were log transformed and are presented as geometric means. Logistic regression models controlling for age, sex, income, and weight category estimate adjusted odd ratios (aOR) of elevated ALT by quartile of arsenic and tested for effect modification by race/ethnicity and weight. Elevated ALT was defined as >25 IU/L and >22 IU/L for boys and girls </=17 years, respectively and >30 IU/L and >19 IU/L for men and women, respectively. RESULTS: Among all, aOR of elevated ALT were higher among those in the highest vs. lowest arsenic quartile (referent), 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1, 1.7) with a borderline significant interaction (p = 0.07) by race/ethnicity but not weight (p = 0.4). In analysis stratified by race/ethnicity, aOR of elevated ALT among those in the 4th quartile were higher among Mexican Americans, 2.0 (CI: 1.3, 3.1) and non-Hispanic whites only, aOR 1.4 (CI: 1.1, 1.8) despite the fact that obesity prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic blacks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a positive association between urinary arsenic exposure and risk of NAFLD among U.S. adolescents and adults that is highest among Mexican Americans and among those obese, regardless of race/ethnicity.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Toxic prolongation of the QRS interval most often results from blockade of cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels and manifests on electrocardiogram with a right bundle-branch block-like morphology. Rarely, a left bundle-branch block (LBBB) morphology has been reported. CASE REPORT: We report a case of transient LBBB resultant from ingestion of lamotrigine and citalopram which was refractory to sodium bicarbonate therapy and eventually resolved spontaneously. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Cases of toxic LBBB are less likely to respond to bicarbonate therapy, suggesting that this finding is due to a mechanism other than sodium channel blockade.

BACKGROUND: Misoprostol is a synthetic analog of prostaglandin-E1 and it is the most widely used drug for the medical management of incomplete abortion. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) rarely occurs in perimenopausal women, in addition, its presentation is atypical, so the disease is not always recognized. CASE REPORT: We describe a case of 39-year-old woman with no major underlying cardiovascular risk factors, who developed an episode of ACS following the administration of two doses of misoprostol. After the discontinuation of misoprostol treatment, there was a complete resolution of patient's symptoms. The case draws attention to a rare side effect of a commonly used drug and alerts the clinicians to be cautious in those patients having baseline risk factors which make the patient more susceptible to such serious adverse drug effect.

29476290	2019/3/5	Trastuzumab	Olfaction Disorders	Journal Article	0	1	0	0	0	Taste and smell perception and quality of life during and after systemic therapy for breast cancer.	PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to assess self-reported taste and smell perception after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients compared with women without cancer, and to assess whether taste and smell perception is associated with quality of life after the end of chemotherapy. METHODS: We included 135 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who completed chemotherapy and 114 women without cancer. Questionnaires on taste, smell, and quality of life were completed shortly after and 6 months after chemotherapy (patients) or at two moments with 6 months' time window in between (comparisons). RESULTS: Self-reported taste and smell perception were significantly lower in patients shortly after chemotherapy compared to the comparison group. Most patients recovered 6 months after chemotherapy, although patients who were still receiving trastuzumab then reported a lower taste and smell perception compared to patients who were not. A lower self-reported taste and smell were statistically significantly associated with a worse quality of life, social, emotional, and role functioning shortly after chemotherapy. Six months after chemotherapy, taste and smell were statistically significantly associated with quality of life, social and role functioning, but only in patients receiving trastuzumab. CONCLUSIONS: Most taste and smell alterations recovered within 6 months after the end of chemotherapy for breast cancer, but not for patients receiving trastuzumab. These results highlight the importance of monitoring taste and smell alterations during and after treatment with chemotherapy and trastuzumab, as they may impact quality of life.
30197188	2019/1/29	Bevacizumab	Late Onset Disorders	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	0	1	0	1	0	[Not Available].	"We report cases of delayed, sustained elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) associated with repeated intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (IVI), which ultimately resulted in the need for filtering surgery. Two of the three cases demonstrated severe IOP elevation despite maximal medical treatment following unilateral IVI and required urgent filtering surgery. Optic nerve involvement was severe in all three cases. These intravitreal injections were performed for exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and the patients did not show any sign of glaucoma or ocular hypertension prior to the initiation of treatment. Elevated IOP secondary to intravitreal steroids is a well-known side effect, as is immediate transient IOP elevation associated with anti-VEGF injection. Late, sustained IOP elevation after repeated injections of anti-VEGF, described approximately ten years ago, is often underestimated. Its incidence is estimated between 2.1 % and 13 % according to studies and increases with the number of IVI (cumulative effect). The pathophysiologic process is becoming increasingly understood, and several risk factors for this chronic IOP elevation have been identified. Most often, it is a moderate IOP elevation for which topical monotherapy is sufficient, or sometimes two, three or four medications or even selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). However, filtering surgery may rarely be required. Our findings illustrate a little-described phenomenon: a sudden, severe, late IOP elevation in response to anti-VEGF by an ""overflow"" effect, requiring urgent filtering surgery."

Methylphenidate (MP) is the most prescribed psychostimulant for ADHD patients, with clinically demonstrated detrimental effects on bone quality, potentially leading to early onset osteoporosis and higher fracture risk. The underlying mechanism for the effects of MP on bone remains elusive. This study demonstrates that sex- and dose-dependent effects of MP on bone quality and quantity are mediated by osteoclast activity. Four-week-old male and female rats were treated with low and high dose MP for 13 weeks. Bone quality and quantity were analyzed using microCT, mechanical testing, histomorphometry, and TRAP staining. Male and female rat bone marrow-derived osteoclasts were treated in a dose-dependent manner (0-1000 ng/ml) and osteoclast activity was determined at days 5, 7, and 14 using TRAP staining, as well as a pit formation assay at day 18. Animal studies showed a dose- and a sex-dependent decrease in mechanical integrity in femora and increased TRAP staining in MP-treated rats. Primary cultures revealed that MP had direct dose- and sex-dependent effects on osteoclast activity, as seen by increased differentiation, activity, and resorption. This study demonstrates for the first time that osteoclasts are differentially regulated by MP in adolescent male and female rats, resulting in sex-dependent effects on the skeleton.

29222350	2019/1/23	Leflunomide	Premature Birth	Journal Article_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	1	0	0	0	0	Leflunomide use during pregnancy and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.	OBJECTIVES: Leflunomide is known to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rodents. However, there is less evidence in humans. We quantified the risk of major congenital malformation (MCM), prematurity, low birth weight (LBW) and spontaneous abortion associated with leflunomide exposure during pregnancy in humans. METHODS: From a cohort of 289 688 pregnancies in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from 1998 to 2015, first-trimester leflunomide exposure and other antirheumatic drug exposures were studied for their association with MCM and spontaneous abortions. Also second or third-trimester leflunomide exposures were examined for associations with prematurity and LBW. Logistic regression model-based generalised estimating equations were used. RESULTS: 51 pregnancies were exposed to leflunomide during the first trimester, and 21 during the second/third trimesters. Adjusting for potential confounders, use of leflunomide during the first trimester of pregnancy was not associated with the risk of MCM (adjusted OR (aOR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16; 5 exposed cases). No association was found between second/third-trimester exposure to leflunomide and the risk of prematurity (aOR 4.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 17.85; 7 exposed cases) nor LBW (aOR 1.06, 95%CI 0.90 to 1.25; 8 exposed cases). Pregnancy exposure to leflunomide was also not associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion (aOR 1.09, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.32; 11 exposed cases). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal exposure to leflunomide during pregnancy was not associated with statistically significant increased risk of MCMs, prematurity, LBW or spontaneous abortions. However, given that relatively few women were exposed to leflunomide during pregnancy in this cohort, caution remains warranted.
30217687	2019/5/10	Hydroxyurea	Lymphopenia	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	1	1	[Cytopenia under topical imiquimod in two patients treated with oral hydroxyurea].	BACKGROUND: Aldara((R)) is a topical immunomodulatory treatment. The risks of systemic passage are minimal. There have been rare reports of systemic adverse effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case 1. Five sachets weekly of imiquimod were prescribed for Bowen's disease on the forearm in a patient known to have essential thrombocytosis under Hydrea((R)). His CBC was normal (6000 leukocytes/mm(3), 2200 PMN/mm, 230,000 platelets/mm(3)). Imiquimod was given in 15 sachets weekly. Fifteen day later, the patient presented bicytopenia (3000 leukocytes/mm(3), 1400 PMN/mm(3), 119,000 platelets/mm(3)). Hydroxyurea and imiquimod were suspended until normalization of CBC. Hydroxyurea was resumed without recurrence of the bicytopenia. The patient's history included an identical episode following application of imiquimod. Case 2. Five sachets weekly of imiquimod were prescribed for actinic keratosis on the scalp in a patient known to have primary polycythemia under hydroxyurea. Her CBC was normal except for anemia (Hb 11.5g/L, 160,000 platelets/mm(3), 1100 lymphocytes/mm(3)). Imiquimod was given in 12 sachets weekly. Ten days later, anemia increased (Hb 10g/dL) with lymphopenia (800/mm(3)) and thrombocytopenia (115,000/mm(3)). Suspension of imiquimod resulted in normalization of the previous CBC values. DISCUSSION: . The literature review identified reports of dose-dependent lymphopenia under oral imiquimod but not under Aldara((R)). The National Pharmacovigilance Database listed 10 cases of hematological disorders most likely caused by Aldara((R)). Hydroxyurea may induce cytopenia, and while it was not considered the sole causative agent in this case, it is likely to have had a triggering role in these patients with blood dyscrasias. Our findings show that misuse of imiquimod carries a potential risk of hematologic abnormality in patients receiving concomitant hydroxyurea, a commonly combined drug.
30713304	2019/7/31	Levofloxacin	Hyperventilation	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Levofloxacin-associated Encephalopathy with Severe Hyperventilation.	A 64-year-old woman with no previous mental illness took a single 500 mg tablet of levofloxacin for cystitis. Two hours later, she developed psychosis with involuntary movement and severe hyperventilation with respiratory alkalosis. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings were unremarkable, and an electroencephalogram revealed no epileptiform discharge. Her symptoms improved on the third day after levofloxacin was discontinued. Levofloxacin-associated encephalopathy with psychotic features is a rare adverse event. Disturbance of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) interneurons by levofloxacin may lead to hyperventilation via dysfunction of the brainstem respiratory network. Physicians should be aware of hyperventilation as an additional serious symptom of levofloxacin-associated encephalopathy in acute settings.

28915162	2018/12/15	Gadolinium DTPA	Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects	Journal Article	0	1	0	0	0	The Effect of Perinatal Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents on Adult Mice Behavior.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of perinatal exposure to gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCAs) on the behavior of adulthood offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant Balb/C mice (n = 5 per group) were intravenously injected with gadoterate meglumine (Magnescope, macrocyclic GBCA), gadodiamide (Omniscan, linear GBCA), or vehicle from pregnancy day 15 to 19, corresponding to embryonic day 15 to 19 of the fetus, at 2 mmol/kg body weight per day. Brain samples from dams and pups were collected on postpartum day 28. The total Gd concentration was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (dams, n = 3; gadoterate meglumine-treated pups group, n = 9; and gadodiamide-treated pups group, n = 10). Behavioral testing of offspring was started on postpartum day 70 (control group, n = 22; gadoterate meglumine-treated group, n = 23; and gadodiamide-treated group, n = 20). RESULTS: Higher levels of Gd retention were observed in dams and pups in the gadodiamide-treated group. Perinatal exposure to GBCAs caused anxiety-like behavior, disrupted motor coordination, impaired memory function, stimulated tactile sensitivity, and decreased muscle strength, particularly in the gadodiamide-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we showed that Gd was transferred to pups and was retained in their brain during postnatal development. Gadolinium retention may lead to impaired brain development. These findings indicate that the use of GBCAs in pregnant women should be avoided because it may have adverse effects on the fetus, particularly on brain development.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between the polymorphisms of -1438A/G and 102T/C in the 5-HT2A receptor (HTR2A) gene and nausea/vomiting as a side effect induced by sertraline (SERT) or citalopram (CIT) in patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS: A total of 128 patients were enrolled, 63 patients received CIT, whereas 65 patients were treated with SERT. Nausea/vomiting were assessed with the UKU Side-effects Rating Scale at baseline and at the end of the second and fourth weeks. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was employed to determine genetic differences. RESULTS: We have found that, in the patients treated with CIT, there was a nominally significant difference in the genotypic distribution associated with -1438A/G polymorphism between patients with and without nausea (X(2)  = 6.15, p = 0.041). Moreover, logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between nausea/vomiting as a side effect and -1438A/G polymorphism. That is, patients with the G allele were at a higher risk for developing nausea/vomiting (p = 0.044, odds ratio = 2.213). The 102T/C polymorphism in the HTR2A gene had no significant effect on the nausea/vomiting as a side effect among participants treated with either CIT or SERT. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests the association of the HTR2A gene -1438A/G polymorphism with nausea/vomiting as a side effect related to CIT treatment.

New direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have been approved for treatment and prevention of some thromboembolic diseases: acute and chronic phase of thromboembolic disease, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery and prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. These molecules are an alternative to heparins and vitamin K antagonists. Among these, rivaroxaban (Xarelto((R)), Bayer Schering Pharma) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor, and dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa((R)), Boehringer Ingelheim) is a direct free thrombin inhibitor. These molecules are almost the ideal anticoagulant: oral administration, few drug and food interactions, wide therapeutic target, and especially no lab monitoring. However, their use remains associated with hemorrhagic complications such as gastrointestinal, intracranial or urinary hemorrhages. We describe two clinical cases of spontaneous choroidal hemorrhage in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate) for atrial fibrillation. These cases show that an ocular hemorrhagic risk exists with these drugs. Patients treated with DOAC should have the therapeutic dose adjusted based on creatinine clearance. Special monitoring should be performed in patients with age-related macular degeneration or with hypertension even though meta-analysis shows that the risk of intraocular bleeding is reduced by 22% compared with warfarin.
30950895	2019/8/24	Methylphenidate	Corneal Edema	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Corneal Edema Associated With Systemic Dopaminergic Agents.	PURPOSE: To describe the development and resolution of corneal edema in 3 patients who were exposed to compounds that stimulate dopaminergic pathways. METHODS: We conducted a review of the literature on bilateral corneal edema secondary to amantadine use and report a case series of corneal edema seen in an outpatient ophthalmology specialty clinic, shortly after exposure to agents that enhance dopamine transmission. RESULTS: Cases 1 and 2 report a 25-year-old man with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and a 73-year-old man with Parkinson disease who were placed on dopaminergic medications to treat their conditions. The former was administered methylphenidate and the latter patient was administered ropinirole. Both patients developed corneal edema soon afterward. Case 3 is a 67-year-old man with a recent exposure to resin from Euphorbia resinifera, a cactus in his garden. After cessation of the offending medications and treatment for exposure to resiniferatoxin, the corneal edema progressively resolved and visual acuity returned to baseline in all 3 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate, ropinirole, and resiniferatoxin have different mechanisms of actions but have a common end point leading to increased dopamine. We believe that these agents are linked with the reversible corneal edema seen in our 3 patients. This strongly correlates with previous studies that have linked amantadine, a drug that blocks dopamine reuptake, to reversible corneal edema.

Despite the availability of effective antiemetics, control of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is often suboptimal and there is need of an inexpensive and safer alternative. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of Emblica officinalis Gaertn (Euphorbiaceae) fruit extract (EEEO) on cisplatin-induced delayed gastric emptying in Sprague-Dawley rats so that Emblica officinalis can be clarified for its application in CINV as a potential candidate. Groups I, II, III, IV, and V rats were pretreated orally with 1% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, 1 mL/kg), 1% CMC (1 mL/kg), EEEO (250 mg/kg), EEEO (500 mg/kg), and ondansetron (3 mg/kg), respectively, for 5 consecutive days. Then, Group I rats received 0.1 mL of normal saline and Groups II-V rats received 10 mg/kg body weight of cisplatin intraperitoneally. Immediately after that, a test meal (1.5 mL/rat) was administered to each group, and after 30 minutes, rats were euthanized to evaluate the percentage of gastric emptying. EEEO at the specified doses reversed the cisplatin-induced delayed gastric emptying. EEEO (500 mg/kg body weight) pretreatment for 5 days before cisplatin challenge in Group IV rats significantly (p < .05) increased gastric emptying to 74.25% +/- 7.19%. Reversal of cisplatin-induced delay in gastric emptying by EEEO (500 mg/kg body weight) in Group IV was significantly (p < .05) comparable to that of the ondansetron treated Group V. EEEO possesses the property to reverse the cisplatin-induced delayed gastric emptying and can be used as an antiemetic for the prevention of CINV.
29863419	2019/3/6	Everolimus	Hyponatremia	Clinical Trial_and_Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	Hyponatremia associates with poor outcome in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with everolimus: prognostic impact.	BACKGROUND: The prognostication of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is based on Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk classifications. Research has shown that hyponatremia is associated with worse prognosis in cancer. We analyzed the association of hyponatremia and outcome in everolimus-treated mRCC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Baseline and on-treatment (</=12 weeks) sodium in 233 mRCC patients was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression and logistic regression. Baseline sodium was correlated with baseline thrombocyte and neutrophil values. RESULTS: 65 (28%) and 41 (18%) patients had sodium < lower limit of normal (LLN) at baseline and on-treatment, respectively. Baseline sodium < LLN was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (6.1 vs. 10.3 months; p < .001) and progression-free survival (PFS) (2.8 vs. 3.5 months; p = .04). On-treatment sodium < LLN was associated with shorter OS (5.4 vs. 9.9 months; p < .001) and PFS (2.8 vs. 4.0 months; p < .001). In multivariate analyses adjusted for IMDC factors, baseline and on-treatment sodium < LLN were significantly associated with shorter OS (adjusted HR 1.46 (95% CI 1.04-2.05); p = .02; adjusted HR 1.80 (95% CI 1.23-2.61); p = .002; respectively). On-treatment sodium < LLN was significantly associated with progressive disease (OR 0.23 (95% CI 0.10-0.56); p = .001). A landmark analysis demonstrated that on-treatment hyponatremia was significantly associated with shorter OS and PFS (p = .01 and p = .03, respectively). On-treatment normalization of hyponatremia was associated with improved OS (unadjusted HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.35-0.98); p = .04), as compared to patients with sustained hyponatremia throughout follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia associates with poor outcome in mRCC patients treated with everolimus. On-treatment normalization of hyponatremia to normal sodium values associates with favorable outcome.
30318075	2018/12/12	Aspartame	Dysbiosis	Journal Article_and_Review	1	1	0	0	0	The debate over neurotransmitter interaction in aspartame usage.	Aspartame (NutraSweet(R), Equal(R)) is a widely used artificial sweetener, has been reported to be accountable for neurological and behavioural disturbances in people. Upon ingestion, aspartame is hydrolyzed in gut and provides its metabolite; such as essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phy) (50%), aspartic acid (40%), and methanol (10%). Altered brain neurochemical compositions [such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT)] have long been a concern and being involved in observed neurophysiological symptom (such as headaches, memory loss, mood changes, as well as depression) in aspartame consumers. Aspartames might act as chemical stressor through increasing plasma cortisol level. Aspartame consumption similarly altered gut microbiota. Taken together all this factors, we reviewed to search for convincing evidence, in what manner aspartame metabolites, stress hormones (cortisol), and gut dysbiosisis involved in altering brain neurochemical composition. We concluded that aspartame metabolite; mainly Phy and its interaction with neurotransmitter and aspartic acid by acting as excitatory neurotransmitter causes this pattern of impairments. Along with elevated cortisol and gut dysbiosis via interactions with different biogenic amine may also have additional impact to modulate neuronal signaling lead to neurobiological impairments. Hence ongoing research is instantly needed to understand the specific roles of aspartame metabolite, elevated cortisol, and gut dysbiosis with emerging neurophysiological symptom in aspartame consumers to improve healthy life in its consumers.

PURPOSE: To describe a patient with BRAF mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma who developed acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy during vemurafenib and pembrolizumab treatment for metastatic melanoma. METHODS: Retrospective case report documented with wide-field fundus imaging, spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and fundus autofluorescence imaging. RESULTS: A 55-year-old woman with bilateral ductal breast carcinoma and BRAF mutation-positive metastatic cutaneous melanoma complained of bilateral blurred vision within 5 days of starting vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor). She had been on pembrolizumab (program death receptor antibody) and intermittently on dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor), and had a normal ophthalmologic examination. On presentation three weeks after the introduction of vemurafenib, her visual acuity had declined to 20/40 in both eyes. Her examination showed diffuse elevation of the fovea with multifocal yellow-white, crescent-shaped subretinal deposits within the macula of both eyes and bilateral neurosensory retinal detachments by spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Discontinuation of vemurafenib and introduction of difluprednate and dorzolamide led to a gradual resolution (over four months) of the neurosensory detachments with recovery of vision. CONCLUSION: This case report suggests that acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy may be directly associated with the use of BRAF inhibitors as treatment for metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or indirectly by triggering autoimmune-paraneoplastic processes. Future identification of similar associations is required to unequivocally link vemurafenib and/or pembrolizumab to acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy in metastatic melanoma.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus in men receiving steroid 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (dutasteride or finasteride) for long term treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD; 2003-14) and Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD; 2002-12). PARTICIPANTS: Men in the CPRD who received dutasteride (n=8231), finasteride (n=30 774), or tamsulosin (n=16 270) were evaluated. Propensity score matching (2:1; dutasteride to finasteride or tamsulosin) produced cohorts of 2090, 3445, and 4018, respectively. In the NHIRD, initial numbers were 1251 (dutasteride), 4194 (finasteride), and 86 263 (tamsulosin), reducing to 1251, 2445, and 2502, respectively, after propensity score matching. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: Incident type 2 diabetes using a Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: In the CPRD, 2081 new onset type 2 diabetes events (368 dutasteride, 1207 finasteride, and 506 tamsulosin) were recorded during a mean follow-up time of 5.2 years (SD 3.1 years). The event rate per 10 000 person years was 76.2 (95% confidence interval 68.4 to 84.0) for dutasteride, 76.6 (72.3 to 80.9) for finasteride, and 60.3 (55.1 to 65.5) for tamsulosin. There was a modest increased risk of type 2 diabetes for dutasteride (adjusted hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.61) and finasteride (1.26, 1.10 to 1.45) compared with tamsulosin. Results for the NHIRD were consistent with the findings for the CPRD (adjusted hazard ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 1.54 for dutasteride, and 1.49, 1.38 to 1.61 for finasteride compared with tamsulosin). Propensity score matched analyses showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing new onset type 2 diabetes appears to be higher in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia exposed to 5alpha-reductase inhibitors than in men receiving tamsulosin, but did not differ between men receiving dutasteride and those receiving finasteride. Additional monitoring might be required for men starting these drugs, particularly in those with other risk factors for type 2 diabetes.

Non-ITP autoimmune cytopenias are rarely reported. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and nephropathy in a MS patient treated with alemtuzumab. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old man with MS developed albuminuria and AIHA after the first and only alemtuzumab treatment, with positive Coombs' direct and indirect tests and IgG autoantibodies. Both AIHA and nephropathy resolved 1 month after treatment with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. CONCLUSION: Our report adds to literature on AIHA and nephropathy after alemtuzumab treatment and suggests to add Coombs' tests to the screening panel required for alemtuzumab treatment.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death (PD)-1 receptor have dramatically changed the landscape of metastatic melanoma treatment. Nevertheless, these immuno-modulatory agents have associated side effects, including dermatologic manifestations. To this end, we report a patient with metastatic melanoma that was treated with a PD-1 inhibitor, and subsequently developed inflammation of existing seborrheic keratosis lesions and new verrucous keratoses, a cutaneous side effect that has not been previously reported to our knowledge. The etiology of seborrheic and verrucous keratoses is not well understood, although their physical and histopathologic similarities to chronic viral-derived lesions, such as human papilloma virus, suggest a potential viral association. Chronic viral infections are known to result in T-cell tolerance because of persistent antigen stimulation. PD-1 inhibition is able to reinvigorate exhausted T cells, which are accordingly able to decrease viral load. Thus, the inflammatory reaction, seen in our patient, may be the result of PD-1 inhibition reactivating virally driven T lymphocytes.

BACKGROUND: In various types of pulmonary research, pulmonary function testing (PFT) is performed to quantify the severity of lung disease. Induction of apnea and positive pressure ventilation are required for accurate PFT measurements in non-cooperative subjects. We compared two methods of apnea induction in infant olive baboons (Papio anubis). METHODS: Pulmonary function testing results were compared during apnea induced by hyperventilation (CO(2) washout) vs. intravenous propofol (1 dose 10 mg/kg). PFT was evaluated using a hot-wire pneumotachometer incorporated within an Avea ventilator in nine 1-month-old baboons. RESULTS: Propofol induced apnea faster and more reliably. In both groups, PFT values passed the statistical equivalence test and were not significantly different (Student's t-test). There was a trend toward less data variability after propofol administration. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous propofol was non-inferior to CO(2) washout for apnea induction in infant olive baboons. Propofol induced apnea faster and more reliably and yielded less variable PFT results.
30531137	2019/5/8	Lenalidomide	Inappropriate ADH Syndrome	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	[Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in multiple myeloma patients treated with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone combination therapy].	Hyponatremia occurs while receiving bortezomib-containing combination therapy in multiple myeloma (MM) ; however, the mechanism of hyponatremia remains unclear. A 65-year-old female with MM was treated with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. Fourteen days after chemotherapy initiation, she developed hyponatremia (serum sodium, 127 mEq/l, compared with 136 mEq/l before chemotherapy) with plasma hypo-osmolality and urine hyper-osmolality. She exhibited neither dehydration nor adrenal insufficiency. Her serum arginine vasopressin peptide (AVP) level was 1.5 pg/ml. She was diagnosed with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), wherein causative roles of inflammatory cytokines were strongly suggested in the development because (1) SIADH was triggered by the cessation of the dexamethasone treatment and (2) hyponatremia was successfully treated with prednisolone, which was administered for the complication of drug eruption. Perhaps, bortezomib-induced immune reactions could be involved in a subset of hyponatremia during bortezomib-containing antimyeloma chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a toxic environmental contaminant that can bioaccumulate in humans, cross the placenta, and cause immunological effects in children, including altering their risk of developing allergies. On July 10, 1976, a chemical explosion in Seveso, Italy, exposed nearby residents to a high amount of TCDD. In 1996, the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS) was established to study the effects of TCDD on women's health. Using data from the Seveso Second Generation Health Study, we aim to examine the effect of prenatal exposure to TCDD on the risk of atopic conditions in SWHS children born after the explosion. METHODS: Individual-level TCDD was measured in maternal serum collected soon after the accident. In 2014, we initiated the Seveso Second Generation Health Study to follow-up the children of the SWHS cohort who were born after the explosion or who were exposed in utero to TCDD. We enrolled 677 children, and cases of atopic conditions, including eczema, asthma, and hay fever, were identified by self-report during personal interviews with the mothers and children. Log-binomial and Poisson regressions were used to determine the association between prenatal TCDD and atopic conditions. RESULTS: A 10-fold increase in 1976 maternal serum TCDD (log(10)TCDD) was not significantly associated with asthma (adjusted relative risk (RR) = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.40) or hay fever (adjusted RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.27), but was significantly inversely associated with eczema (adjusted RR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.99). Maternal TCDD estimated at pregnancy was not significantly associated with eczema, asthma, or hay fever. There was no strong evidence of effect modification by child sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that maternal serum TCDD near the time of explosion is associated with lower risk of eczema, which supports other evidence pointing to the dysregulated immune effects of TCDD.
30078546	2019/1/11	Docetaxel	Hematoma	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	[Integrated podiatrist care for prostate cancer patients treated with docetaxel: Feasibility and results].	BACKGROUND: Docetaxel is frequently used for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer patients. Nail toxicity is a commonly described side effect, but no precise recommendation exists concerning its management. We experimented the integration of a podiatrist in routine cancer care. METHODS: Patients having received docetaxel for a metastatic prostate cancer since the arrival of the podiatrist were studied. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were included, half had docetaxel-induced nail toxicity and 18 were referred to the podiatrist. The integration of the podiatrist in routine care was feasible and allowed characterizing nail toxicity. The main lesions observed were non-coagulated nail hematomas, coagulated nail hematomas and onycholysis. This experience led to propose an integrated care for docetaxel-induced nail toxicity. CONCLUSION: The integration of podiatrist care is feasible in routine cancer care and can help improving the management of docetaxel-induced nail toxicity in metastatic prostate cancer patients.

In this global health case study, we describe a case of nicotine addiction due to chronic use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarette) and discuss the beliefs on safety and awareness of their side effects. Many people believe that smoking an e-cigarette (vaping) does not have any side effects, especially among teenagers and young adults. Teenagers using an e-cigarette at a young age are twice as likely to try cigarettes later in their life because of nicotine dependency or other social factors. More recent studies have shown long-term systemic side effects of vaping regardless of traditional cigarette smoking history. This report was done for further assessing their risk and to clear out misconceptions of this large-scale condition.

29249113	2019/7/30	Amlodipine	Hypersensitivity, Delayed	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	1	1	2	[Delayed allergic reaction to amlodipine with a positive lymphocyte transformation test].	BACKGROUND: Amlodipine is one of the third generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers used for hypertension. Mild, moderate and severe reactions have been reported with calcium channel blockers. Cross-reactivity among these drugs has not been established. CLINICAL REPORT: We have presented the case of a patient who developed a delayed pruritic, and erythematous maculopapular skin exanthema after the intake of amlodipine. A positive lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) confirmed the implication of amlodipine in the reaction and showed positivity to another calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, demonstrating cross reactivity. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of hypersensitivity to amlodipine in which the involvement of the drug is confirmed by a positive TTL. TTL could become a good diagnostic alternative for patients who experience late reactions to amlodipine and possibly cross-reactivity with nifedipine.
30013020	2018/11/13	Tadalafil <partly ok>	Ecchymosis	Journal Article	1	1	0	1	1	Possible Drug-nutraceutical Interaction leading to Unexpected Sequelae after Inguinal Hernia Repair.	BACKGROUND Nutraceutical formulations are an area in which physicians should be increasingly aware of their side effects. This case study shows the adverse effects that ginkgo biloba can have when combined with tadalafil following an inguinal hernia repair. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old male presented for repair of a recurrent inguinal hernia and for which the procedure was performed without complication. Upon follow-up, it was noted that he had significant ecchymosis not only in the inguinal region but in the ventral aspect of his penis. Upon further questioning, he reported that he had been taking ginkgo biloba that was stopped 5 days prior to the operation and restarted postoperative day 1. This, combined with tadalafil, was thought to be the reason for the unexpected induration and ecchymosis at the shaft of the penis. After discontinuing both medications, the ecchymosis and induration did resolve. CONCLUSIONS While ecchymosis and induration are expected in the inguinal region, the appearance of significant ecchymosis and induration down the shaft of the penis was unexpected in this case, and therefore we thought it could be due to nutraceutical use of ginkgo biloba combined with tadalafil, which were started postoperatively.
30660191	2019/5/2	Cabergoline	Status Epilepticus	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	1	1	1	Status epilepticus induced by treatment with dopamine agonist therapy for giant prolactinoma: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonists are the standard first-line medical therapy for prolactinoma. We report a rare case of giant prolactinoma with a first epileptic seizure due to rapid reduction of the tumor as a complication of dopamine agonist therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old Japanese man presented to our institution with a history of visual disturbance for 1 year and general fatigue for 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor that arose from the pituitary and extended to the bilateral anterior skull base, the clivus, and the cavernous sinus, with compression of the optic chiasm and the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes. On the basis of the patient's serum concentration of prolactin, we diagnosed a prolactinoma and started dopamine agonist therapy with cabergoline. The patient had a general seizure immediately after starting dopamine agonist therapy and required general anesthetic treatment following the rapid reduction of the tumor. We speculated that the rapid reduction of the tumor resulted in the retraction of the surrounding brain structure, and the epileptic seizure was then induced by dopamine agonist therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We report a rare case of giant prolactinoma with a first epileptic seizure immediately after the initiation of dopamine agonist therapy. Clinicians need to be aware that the rapid reduction of a giant prolactinoma by dopamine agonist therapy may cause an epileptic seizure.

The safety profile of lenalidomide use in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients with del(5q) is well-established, but less is known in non-del(5q) patients. We provide safety data from a randomized, phase 3 trial evaluating lenalidomide in 239 patients with lower-risk non-del(5q) MDS ineligible/refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Compared with placebo, lenalidomide was associated with a higher incidence of grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 86% vs. 44%), but not risk of infection (p = .817) or hemorrhagic events (p = 1.000). Grade 3-4 non-hematologic TEAEs were rare (the incidence of grade 3-4 pneumonia, e.g. was 5.6% in the lenalidomide group and 2.5% in the placebo group). Common grade 1-2 non-hematologic TEAEs did not require dose modifications or treatment discontinuation. Acute myeloid leukemia and second primary malignancies incidence was similar across treatment groups. Lenalidomide had a predictable and manageable safety profile in lower-risk non-del(5q) MDS patients ineligible/refractory to ESAs. Guidance on managing lenalidomide-related TEAEs is provided to help maintain patients on therapy to achieve maximum clinical benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01029262.

Eighty percent of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survive with current treatments. Neurotoxicity is an infrequent adverse event. We describe clinical presentations of neurological toxicity, phases of treatment when these adverse events were more frequent and patients ́ outcome. From January-1995 to December-2015, 1379 ALL cases were admitted. Neurotoxicity was diagnosed in 49 patients (3.6%) and classified according to neurological syndromes. Medical records, laboratory-tests and images were reviewed. The diagnosed syndromes were: a) Methotrexate-leukoencephalopathy (MLE) (35.4%); b) Cerebral-venous-sinus thrombosis following L-Asparaginase administration (26.5%); c) Vincristine-induced-vocal-cord paralysis (VVCP) (14.2%); d) Stroke-associated vasospasm (14%), after high-dose methotrexate e) Severe polyneuropathy (6.1%); f) Methotrexate myelopathy (2%); and g) Pseudotumor-cerebri (2%) associated with corticosteroid therapy. Neurotoxicity was diagnosed during induction in 55% of cases. We conclude that MLE was the most frequent syndrome. VVCP was observed in infants and Down patients. Seizure was the most common symptom and toxicity occurred mainly during induction phase.

INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality despite the staggering improvement in cancer therapeutics. So far, published data illustrate endocrine therapy as the cornerstone treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. Unfortunately, most patients eventually develop resistance to this treatment. METHODS: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition in reversing hormone resistance in the Lebanese breast cancer patients. Efficacy of the intervention according to the independent factors and notable side effects encountered were the primary points of the evaluation. RESULTS: In total, fifty patients received the combination of everolimus and exemestane. The mean age of the study population was 61 +/- 11 years. Sensitivity to hormonal therapy before the start of the combination treatment was estimated at 64%. Response rate was 14%, and all patients were partial responders. After regular interval evaluation, the median progression-free survival was 5.2 months since the initiation of therapy. The main toxicities associated with the combination were stomatitis (22%), myalgia (22%), skin toxicity (8%), and hyperglycemia (4%), all Grades 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: Everolimus has been shown to be effective in overcoming hormonal resistance in Lebanese breast cancer patients with results inferior to those reported in the BOLERO-2 population. The particular differences in molecular and pathological aspects of breast cancer in our region should stimulate the extensive research for a better understanding of the particular pattern of the disease.

A 30-year-old insomniac, an off-label user of quetiapine, presented with blurring of central vision, eventually diagnosed as central serous chorioretinopathy. A potential association was suspected based on the drug's actions on the autonomic nervous system. He showed improvement on drug withdrawal; then he unwittingly resumed quetiapine and had a recurrence. Possible underlying mechanisms that include alteration in choroidal perfusion through serotonin and dopamine receptors are discussed. Although retinal vein occlusions and pigment epithelial detachment have been described with quetiapine, to the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of quetiapine-associated central serous chorioretinopathy.

Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic drug with a polypharmacological mechanism of action and a favorable tolerability profile. Its major indications are schizophrenia and mania in adults and adolescents. Here we present the case of a 43-year-old Caucasian man with schizophrenia who developed atrial fibrillation (AF) after starting aripiprazole treatment. Prior to this treatment, he had never received any antipsychotic drugs. On admission to our inpatient unit, he showed severe psychotic symptoms and was started on aripiprazole with a rapid titration regimen (15 mg on the first day and then 15 mg twice daily thereafter) in combination with lorazepam (2.5 mg thrice a day). On the third day, the patient exhibited vomiting and an irregular pulse. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed new-onset AF with rapid ventricular response. Aripiprazole was discontinued and cardioversion was obtained with intravenous amiodarone. A different antipsychotic treatment was thus started (perphenazine 12 mg/d), which led to symptom remission without any relevant adverse effects. During the 2-year follow-up observation, neither psychotic symptoms nor ECG abnormalities were detected. Besides aripiprazole, other co-occurring factors might have contributed to the onset of AF in our patient, namely hypertension, low-grade diastolic dysfunction, chronic inflammatory disease, CYP2D6 polymorphism, corticosteroid and antiulcer treatment, and a family loading for myocardial infarction. In conclusion, our case study suggests that although aripiprazole has fewer cardiovascular effects than other antipsychotic drugs, in the presence of concomitant risk factors, high dose, and rapid titration regimen, regular monitoring of clinical parameters and ECG is highly recommended.

Among members of the genus Bos, aspiration pneumonia has been described in domestic cattle ( Bos taurus and Bos indicus). In these species, aspiration pneumonia is most commonly a sequelae to oral administration of fluids or medications, as well as aspiration during procedures under anesthesia. Management of aspiration pneumonia secondary to complications from anesthesia for short duration surgical procedures is minimally reported in the Tibetan yak ( Bos grunniens). Although regurgitation under anesthesia has been reported in the yak, there are no reports of aspiration pneumonia treatment. This case report describes the diagnosis and management of aspiration pneumonia in two Tibetan yaks undergoing castration under injectable ketamine-xylazine-butorphanol anesthesia. This case report also describes the gross and pathologic characteristics of anesthesia-induced aspiration pneumonia in one Tibetan yak, as well as successful treatment in another.

Gastrointestinal motility is regulated by neural factors and humoral factors. Both motilin and ghrelin improve gastrointestinal motility, but many issues remain unclear. We prepared human motilin receptor transgenic (Tg) mice and performed experiments evaluating the effects of motilin, erythromycin (EM), and ghrelin. EM and ghrelin promoted gastric emptying (GE) when administered either peripherally or centrally to Tg mice. Atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist) counteracted GE induced by centrally administered EM, but not that induced by peripherally administered EM. The administration of EM in this model promoted the effect of mosapride (a selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist), and improved loperamide (a mu-opioid receptor agonist)-induced gastroparesis. The level of acyl-ghrelin was significantly attenuated by EM administration. Thus, we have established an animal model appropriate for the evaluation of motilin receptor agonists. These data and the model are expected to facilitate the identification of novel compounds with clinical potential for relieving symptoms of dyspepsia and gastroparesis.
29626003	2019/2/6	Fidaxomicin	Pancytopenia	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Probable fidaxomicin-induced pancytopenia.	PURPOSE: A case of pancytopenia in a patient receiving treatment with fidaxomicin for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is described. SUMMARY: A 33-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of loose stools occurring approximately 7 times a day; she also reported fever, nausea, diffuse abdominal pain, and fatigue. The patient had a history of recurrent CDI, recurrent urinary tract infections, nephrolithiasis, chronic hepatitis C, and endometriosis. Her previous therapies for CDI included metronidazole, vancomycin, rifaximin, and fecal microbiota transplantation. On admission, she had a platelet count of 172,000 platelets/mm(3), hemoglobin concentration of 11.1 g/dL, and white blood cell (WBC) count of 3,100 cells/mm(3). Within 24 hours of the first dose of fidaxomicin and before the second dose, the patient's platelet count fell to 156,000 platelets/mm(3), her hemoglobin concentration decreased to 9.9 g/dL, and her WBC count fell to 2,600 cells/mm(3). Values for all 3 tests continued to decrease during the first few days of fidaxomicin therapy. One dose of filgrastim 300 mug was administered subcutaneously on day 6 in response to the pancytopenia, after which the platelet, hemoglobin, and WBC values stabilized for a day and then generally declined. Platelet, hemoglobin, and WBC values returned to normal within 3 days of the patient's last dose of fidaxomicin. Use of the Naranjo et al. adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable association (score of 6) between fidaxomicin and the patient's pancytopenia. CONCLUSION: A 33-year-old woman developed pancytopenia during a course of fidaxomicin therapy for CDI. Platelet, hemoglobin, and WBC values returned to normal within 3 days of the final fidaxomicin dose.
29599381	2018/9/25	Capecitabine <ok>	Bipolar Disorder	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	1	1	Secondary mania following cancer chemotherapy with capecitabine.	Mania-like states occurring due to neurological, metabolic or toxic conditions, without a primary mood disorder have been reported in scientific literature as secondary mania. A major clinical problem in such situations often stems from the difficulty to understand if the mood disturbance is indeed secondary to an organic cause or a coincidental primary mood disorder. Chemotherapy regimens have been associated with multiple psychiatric complications, including psychosis, mania and anxiety. Capecitabine is implicated to be associated with encephalopathy whose clinical presentation often mimics that of psychosis. However, presentations with mania have not been reported until with the capecitabine and oxaliplatin combination chemotherapy regimen. In this report, we describe a case of secondary mania in a patient suffering from carcinoma colon on treatment with chemotherapy regimen of capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

OBJECTIVE: Human obesity is a complex metabolic disorder disproportionately affecting people of lower socioeconomic strata, and ethnic minorities, especially African Americans and Hispanics. Although genetic predisposition and a positive energy balance are implicated in obesity, these factors alone do not account for the excess prevalence of obesity in lower socioeconomic populations. Therefore, environmental factors, including exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants, are agents widely suspected to have obesogenic activity, and they also are spatially correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Our study investigates the causal relationship between exposure to the heavy metal, cadmium (Cd), and obesity in a cohort of children and in a zebrafish model of adipogenesis. DESIGN: An extensive collection of first trimester maternal blood samples obtained as part of the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) was analyzed for the presence of Cd, and these results were cross analyzed with the weight-gain trajectory of the children through age 5 years. Next, the role of Cd as a potential obesogen was analyzed in an in vivo zebrafish model. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the presence of Cd in maternal blood during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of juvenile obesity in the offspring, independent of other variables, including lead (Pb) and smoking status. Our results are recapitulated in a zebrafish model, in which exposure to Cd at levels approximating those observed in the NEST study is associated with increased adiposity. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify Cd as a potential human obesogen. Moreover, these observations are recapitulated in a zebrafish model, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved, and that zebrafish may be a valuable model for uncovering pathways leading to Cd-mediated obesity in human populations.

Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a new laparoscopic administration of chemotherapy for peritoneal metastasis (PM). PIPAC is repeated every 5th week, and seems to stabilize or improve quality of life, and might improve survival. So far, PIPAC has been well tolerated. With this paper, we aim to highlight a potential severe adverse reaction, as we describe the first cases of severe peritoneal sclerosis (SPS) caused by PIPAC. Patients with isolated PM were included in a prospective PIPAC protocol. Following insufflation of normothermic CO(2), laparoscopy was performed at an intraabdominal pressure of 12 mmHg. After peritoneal lavage and quadrant biopsies of the PM, the patients were treated with oxaliplatin 92 mg/m(2) (flowrate 0.5 ml/s, maximum pressure of 200 per square inch). Treatment related toxicity was evaluated after 2 weeks. Response was evaluated histologically by the Peritoneal Regression Grading Score (PRGS) and cytologically by analysis of the lavage fluid. In a series of 24 PIPAC patients treated with oxaliplatin, two patients developed SPS. Patient one had a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix with PM, the mean PRGS was reduced from 2.75 to 1.75 during the course of therapy. Patient two had an appendiceal goblet cell carcinoid with a dominating mucinous adenocarcinoma component with PM, the mean PRGS was reduced from 2.00 to 1.67. Repeated applications of PIPAC with oxaliplatin can lead to SPS.

The Committee on Indoor Guide Values is issuing indoor air guide values to protect public health. At present, no suitable human studies are available for health evaluation of propan-1,2-diol in indoor air. In a well-documented subchronic inhalation animal study with rats, assessed as reliable, nasal hemorrhages were observed. This study leads to a LOAEC of 28.6 mg/m3 propan-1,2-diol for continuous exposure for the endpoint nasal hemorrhages. By applying a conversion factor of 2 from subchronic to chronic exposure, an interspecies factor of 2.5, and a factor of 10 for interindividual variability a health hazard guide value (RW II) of 0.6 mg/m3 propan-1,2-diol is obtained. A health precaution guide value (RW I) of 0.06 mg/m3 is recommended.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in healthy Chinese women and to investigate whether these outcomes could be decreased in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate (EE/CPA) pretreatment. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Medical university. PATIENT(S): Six thousand healthy women (group A) were selected from 24,566 pregnant women by randomized sampling. Four hundred forty-eight patients with PCOS without EE/CPA pretreatment were assigned to group B, and 222 patients with PCOS with 3 months of pretreatment to group C. All patients with PCOS had biochemical and/or clinical hyperandrogenism and conceived within 3 monthly ovulation inductions using clomiphene. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), premature delivery (PD), and neonatal birth weight. RESULT(S): The prevalence of GDM, PIH, and PD was higher in group B than in groups A and C (A vs. B vs. C: GDM, 21.2% vs. 35.0% vs. 22.5%; PIH, 6.5% vs. 14.1% vs. 7.7%; PD, 5.4% vs. 8.6% vs. 6.8%). No significant difference was found in neonatal birth weight. After adjusting for age, pregestational body mass index, education level, and employment status, PCOS without pretreatment increased the risk of GDM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.666; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.340-2.072), PIH (aOR = 1.487; 95% CI, 1.093-2.023), and PD (aOR = 1.522; 95% CI 1.051-2.205), compared with healthy women. No increased risk was found in group C. CONCLUSION(S): In our highly selected study population, patients with PCOS are more likely to develop GDM, PIH, and PD. Pretreatment with EE/CPA was associated with a lower risk of GDM, PIH, and PD.

Purpose/aim: We describe, in detail, the first case of isotretinoin-induced aseptic meningitis. A brief summary of the literature on drug-induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) is also presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 20-year old female patient with probable (Naranjo adverse reaction probability score of 7) DIAM during treatment with isotretinoin therapy for nodular acne solely, presenting with headache. Pseudotumor cerebri was appropriately ruled-out. RESULTS: Summary of data altogether lead us suggest that isotretinoin triggered DIAM, possible due to a delayed hypersensitivity mechanism type III or IV. CONCLUSION: We highlight a quite uncommon cause of DIAM that may be increasing in frequency due to the current increasing use of isotretinoin against nodular acne.

We report the case of a 75-year-old woman who developed band keratopathy following denosumab therapy. The patient was referred for evaluation of progressive vision loss and new-onset band keratopathy in both eyes following denosumab therapy. She had no prior ocular history. On examination, she had calcific deposits in a horizontal band in the interpalpebral superficial cornea. Laboratory workup was negative. Denosumab was discontinued, and she was treated with keratectomy with ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid. Denosumab influences calcium metabolism and consequently reduces bone turnover and increases bone density. It is commonly used for treatment of osteoporosis at high-risk for fracture. Very few cases of ocular adverse drug reactions have been reported. However, because of temporal association and biological plausibility, we believe our patient developed progressive band keratopathy after administration of denosumab.
30672576	2019/7/2	Linoleic Acid	Dysbiosis	Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	A high linoleic acid diet exacerbates metabolic responses and gut microbiota dysbiosis in obese rats with diabetes mellitus.	Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels may affect inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism. Gut microbiota diversity is strongly associated with chronic inflammatory disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), and obesity through abnormal energy homeostasis. In this study, the association between metabolic responses and gut microbiota diversity at different dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios was evaluated in DM rats. Obesity and DM were induced in rats by using a high-fat diet and streptozotocin (STZ), respectively. The obese DM rats were assigned to three groups and administered regular (R), high (H), and low (L) n-6/n-3 ratio diets (n-6/n-3 = 6.39, 3.02, and 9.29, respectively) for 6 weeks. Some metabolic parameters and gut microbiota of the rats were analysed. The results revealed that a high linoleic acid diet increased the plasma and kidney interleukin 6 levels, whereas a low n-6/n-3 ratio diet ameliorated blood glucose homeostasis, reduced plasma tumour necrosis factor alpha levels, and inhibited systematic inflammation. DM rats exhibited low gut microbiota diversity; however, compared with the R group, the L and H groups did not exhibit alterations in the alpha-diversity (Observed, Chao 1, Shannon and Simpson). The percentage of Firmicutes was lower in the DM groups than in the non-DM group; however, the L group showed a nonsignificantly higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio than did the other groups. Thus, a low n-6/n-3 ratio diet can improve blood glucose homeostasis, reduce systematic inflammation, ameliorate glomerular basal membrane thickening, reduce the expression of receptors of advanced glycation end products in renal vessel walls, and prevent diabetic nephropathies.

A 69-year-old man started taking the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, vildagliptin. One week later, C-reactive protein and plasma immunoglobulin E levels were markedly elevated, and the vildagliptin was stopped. After the patient's laboratory findings were normalized, we decided to restart vildagliptin with the patient's agreement. The next day, he had a high fever, and C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were elevated. Although we failed to find a focus of infection, we started antibiotics therapy. Two days later, the high fever had improved, and the C-reactive protein level had decreased. A drug lymphocyte stimulation test showed a positive result for vildagliptin. We examined various kinds of cytokine and infection markers just before and after the treatment with vildagliptin. Finally, we diagnosed the patient with vildagliptin-induced drug fever, probably based on the increase of various inflammatory cytokine levels and the response to this. Taken together, we should be aware of the possibility of vildagliptin inducing drug fever and/or acute inflammation.

Causality assessment is crucial to post-marketing pharmacovigilance and helps optimize safe and appropriate use of medicines by patients in the real world. Self-reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common in the general population as well as in patients with allergic rhinitis and nasal polyposis. Intranasal corticosteroids, including intranasal fluticasone propionate (INFP), are amongst the most effective drugs indicated in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and nasal polyposis. While intranasal corticosteroids are associated with olfactory and gustatory dysfunction and are currently labeled for these adverse events, causality assessment has not been performed to date. Although there is no single widely accepted method to assess causality in pharmacovigilance, the Bradford Hill criteria offer a robust and comprehensive approach because nine distinct aspects of an observed potential drug-event association are assessed. In this literature-based narrative review, Hill's criteria were applied to determine causal inference between INFP and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based antineoplastic agent used for the treatment of colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal tumors. In combination with 5-fluorouracil for instance it is given in the so-called FOLFOX regimen in patients with colorectal cancer in the adjuvant as well as the palliative treatment setting. Cumulative neuropathy is a common cause of treatment discontinuation. Other toxicities are generally tolerable and managed by dose reductions and/or supportive treatment. While chronic cardiotoxic effects of cytostatics are well described, there are few reports on acute cardiotoxic reactions. CASE REPORT: The present case describes the sudden development of a transient coronary vasospasm in a 56-year-old male patient mimicking an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction during systemic treatment with oxaliplatin. CONCLUSION: Oxaliplatin is one of the most commonly used cytostatics for gastrointestinal cancer. Coronary vasospasm has never been reported for oxaliplatin. Thus it is crucial to keep in mind that acute cardiotoxic side effects may occur, even with chemotherapeutic agents without a prior evidence-based description of such events.

Plasma levels of voriconazole were insufficient with a standard dose (0.7 mug/mL), therefore, the dose was increased thereafter to reach appropriate levels (4.5 mug/mL). Anti-retroviral therapy was started five weeks after voriconazole initiation with non-interacting drugs and he was discharged after a favorable evolution. He was re-admitted three months later due to seizures; a brain magnetic resonance showed new sub-cortical nodules. After excluding alternative causes and demonstrating fungal eradication, an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) event was suspected and treated with a short course of steroids. His evolution was satisfactory.

INTRODUCTION: Adalimumab, an anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha therapy for active Crohn's disease (CD), is associated with increased risks of tuberculosis infection. CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 48 year-old male with active CD on treatment with adalimumab. After three months, he developed a miliary pulmonary tuberculosis infection, with a solitary non-reactive choroidal tubercle temporal-superior to the optic disc being found in an ophthalmological study. Fluorescein angiography showed late hyperfluorescence in a staining pattern. Optic coherence tomography showed a flat mass without serous retinal detachment. The choroidal tubercle slowly regressed with antituberculosis therapy. DISCUSSION: Choroidal tubercles with no vitreo-retinal symptomatology can be present in patients with CD and on treatment with adalimumab.

BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is a life-threatening syndrome. The usage of a dopamine agonist, such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, is considered a predisposing factor for PA, which commonly occurs 1.5 years within commencement. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old female with a >15-year history of cabergoline therapy for pituitary prolactinoma was referred to our department of neurosurgery after complaining of headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and ptosis for 3 days during hospital admission for chemotherapy of chronic myelocytic leukemia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed findings indicative of PA. As the patient was experiencing thrombocytopenia related to chemotherapy, blood transfusion was preceded, and after a platelet count of 15.0 x 104/muL was confirmed, transnasal neuroendoscopic surgery was performed 5 days from the onset of symptoms. The majority of the prolactinoma was removed, and the prolactinoma in the cavernous sinus was intentionally left. The postoperative course was generally good. The ptosis and diplopia improved, and the blurred vision resolved. CONCLUSIONS: PA related to dopamine agonist therapy can occur in cases of elevated bleeding tendency, even in long-term users, suggesting that attention should be paid in the administration of a dopamine agonist in the patient experiencing thrombocytopenia. Surgical intervention should be performed after the preoperative platelet number and adequate response to transfusion are confirmed, and the aggressive removal of prolactinoma in the cavernous sinus should be avoided to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications.
29654781	2018/10/16	Propofol	Cell Transformation, Neoplastic	Journal Article_and_Review	1	1	0	0	0	Effects of propofol on cancer development and chemotherapy: Potential mechanisms.	Propofol (2, 6-diisopropylphenol) is the commonly used intravenous sedative-hypnotic agent. Accumulating evidence shows that propofol affects cancer development by direct and indirect ways. In this review, we will provide an overview of the effects of propofol on cancer development and chemotherapy, with a special focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. Propofol regulates both microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and serves as a regulator of different signaling pathways including hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and nuclear factor E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) pathways. In addition, propofol modulates host immune function. Possible correlation between propofol and cancer should be verified in further studies, including animal trials and prospective clinical studies.

AIMS: A recent large epidemiological study found fluoroquinolone use is associated with an increased risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection. We aimed to examine fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin) associated aortic aneurysm or dissection through data mining of the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). METHODS: Reports to the FAERS from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2016 were analysed. Pharmacovigilance tools were used for quantitative detection of signals that is, drug-associated adverse events, including reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, information component given by a Bayesian confidence propagation neural network and empirical Bayes geometric mean. Sensitivity analyses that limited the data by gender and adverse event date also showed similar trends. RESULTS: Based on 3721 adverse event reports, all three fluoroquinolones are associated with aortic aneurysm, and levofloxacin is associated with aortic dissection. The risk of aortic aneurysm is higher than the aortic dissection. Oral administration of fluoroquinolones is more likely to produce these adverse events. CONCLUSION: The results obtained herein are consistent with clinical observations, suggesting the necessity for further clinical research on aortic aneurysm and dissection associated with fluoroquinolones.

BACKGROUND: Folate supplementation in women of reproductive age has a well-established role in the prevention of neural tube defects. Methotrexate is a commonly used drug which functions by inhibiting normal folate metabolism in active cells. An association between fetal methotrexate exposure and myelomeningocele might be expected, considering this relationship. However, to our knowledge, no cases of myelomeningocele secondary to in utero methotrexate exposure have been reported. CASE: We present the case of a gravid patient who, having received methotrexate for management of an ectopic pregnancy, was lost to follow-up and returned several weeks later carrying an intrauterine pregnancy. The fetus was found prenatally to be suffering from multiple congenital anomalies. At birth the infant demonstrated many of the abnormalities commonly associated with fetal methotrexate syndrome, including craniosynostosis and talipes equinovarus. Most interestingly, the newborn was also diagnosed with a lumbar myelomeningocele and concomitant type II Chiari malformation, as is often associated with such a neural tube defect. CONCLUSION: Methotrexate exposure may impact the fetal risk of myelomeningocele. Patients should be counseled thoroughly on the importance of follow-up care.

29622043	2018/9/25	Aripiprazole	Night Eating Syndrome	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	1	1	2	Aripiprazole-induced sleep-related eating disorder: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Sleep-related eating disorder is characterized by parasomnia with recurrent episodes of nocturnal eating or drinking during the main sleep period. Several drugs, including atypical antipsychotics, induce sleep-related eating disorder. However, aripiprazole has not previously been associated with sleep-related eating disorder. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old Japanese man visited our clinic complaining of depression. The patient was treated with sertraline, which was titrated up to 100 mg for 4 weeks. A sleep inducer and an anxiolytic were coadministered. His depressive mood slightly improved, but it continued for an additional 4 months. Subsequently, aripiprazole (3 mg) was added as an adjunctive therapy. After 3 weeks, the patient's mother found that the patient woke up and ate food at night. The next morning, the patient was amnesic for this event, felt full, and wondered why the bags of food were empty. This episode lasted for 2 days. The patient gained 5 kg during these 3 weeks. After the aripiprazole dose was reduced to 1.5 mg, the patient's nocturnal eating episodes rapidly and completely disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is first report of sleep-related eating disorder induced by aripiprazole, and it indicates that this disorder should be considered a possible side effect of aripiprazole. Although aripiprazole is used mainly in patients with schizophrenia, its recently documented use as an adjunctive therapy in patients with depression might induce hitherto unknown side effects.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To describe a case of serous retinopathy and associated photoreceptor atrophy after intravenous cisplatin therapy. METHODS: Evaluation was performed using electroretinogram, optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, and funduscopic examinations to assess the extent of retinal disease, toxicity, and eventual atrophy. RESULTS: A 56 year-old man with metastatic small cell carcinoma with vision changes after initiation of cisplatin therapy. The patient developed loss of vision to 20/400. A serous retinopathy was found on spectral domain optical coherence tomography with associated outer retinal atrophy and subretinal fibrosis. He developed outer ellipsoid layer atrophy after discontinuation of cisplatin therapy. He had patchy hypoautofluorescent areas in his macula on fundus autofluorescence and decreased cone response and slowed b-wave on electroretinogram. The serous retinopathy resolved with discontinuation of cisplatin and the malignancy was further managed with etoposide without recurrence of subretinal serous fluid or further vision loss. CONCLUSION: Commonly used to treat various solid tumors, cisplatin is not without significant neurologic, ocular, and retinal toxicities. Multimodal imaging may further the authors' understanding of toxicity and this case highlights the benefits of optical coherence tomography, especially with color vision deviation or visual acuity change.
28825378	2019/1/16	Nivolumab	Autoimmune Hypophysitis	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	0	1	0	1	1	Immunotherapy-induced autoimmune hypophysitis.	Autoimmune hypophysitis is an immune-related adverse event of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In this article, we present the case of a 58-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency room with gradually worsening nonspecific symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting and decreased oral intake of one week duration. The patient had been diagnosed with relapsed extensive stage small cell lung cancer. She was being treated with a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab after progression on chemotherapy. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of head revealed pituitary enlargement up to 1.5 cm and pituitary stalk enlargement up to 4 mm consistent with hypophysitis. The patient was treated with corticosteroids resulting in rapid resolution of her symptoms. The objective of our report is to highlight this rare but important adverse event associated with checkpoint inhibitors, and discuss its clinical features, diagnostic work-up and treatment.

A 55-year-old woman with concurrent active thyroid orbitopathy and B-cell lymphoma developed acute exacerbation of thyroid orbitopathy after receiving Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, Prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy, presenting with subtotal loss of vision and severe eyelid edema. Intravenous methylprednisolone was fully effective within several hours. Further exacerbations of her orbitopathy were seen following every subsequent chemotherapeutic treatment, but responded well to oral prednisone. This case shows that thyroid orbitopathy may severely and acutely progress after chemotherapy for concurrent B-cell lymphoma. Clinical awareness of this potential complication may prevent blindness in this rare subset of patients.

BACKGROUND: Biomarkers of cardiac damages, such as troponin T (TnT) and the amino-terminal fragment of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), may be useful as early predictors of cardiac dysfunction. The role of these biomarkers in patients receiving lapatinib and/or trastuzumab before anthracyclines is unknown. This study explores TnT and NT-proBNP as predictors of early cardiac toxicity in neoadjuvant breast cancer patients. METHODS: This sub-study of the NEOALTTO trial tested if changes in the levels of TnT and NT-proBNP occurred after 2 weeks of anti-HER2 therapy (lapatinib, trastuzumab or their combination) alone and/or after 18 weeks of anti-HER2 therapy plus weekly paclitaxel. RESULTS: 173 and 172 were tested at all three timepoints for NT-proBNP and TnT, respectively. The incidence of biomarker elevation was overall low at all timepoints for all the three treatment arms. A total of 13 CEs in 11 patients occurred. Biomarker elevations in patients with CEs were very rare; only one patient with subsequent CE had a NT-proBNP elevation at baseline and at week 2. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TnT and proBNP may not be useful as early predictors of cardiac toxicity in anthracycline-naive patients receiving trastuzumab and/or lapatinib.

BACKGROUND: New Zealand has funded the administration of tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy to prevent infant pertussis since 2013. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of Tdap vaccine administered to pregnant women as part of a national maternal immunisation programme. METHODS: We conducted a national retrospective observational study using linked administrative New Zealand datasets. The study population consisted of pregnant women eligible to receive funded Tdap vaccination from 28 to 38 weeks gestation in 2013. Primary study outcomes were based on prioritised adverse events for the assessment of vaccine safety in pregnant women, as defined by WHO and Brighton Collaboration taskforces. We examined the effect of Tdap vaccination on prioritised maternal outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. Adjusted hazard ratios controlled for key confounding variables. RESULTS: In the cohort of 68,550 women eligible to receive funded antenatal Tdap vaccination during 2013, 8178 (11.9%) were vaccinated and 60,372 (88.1%) were unvaccinated. The use of Tdap in pregnancy was not associated with an increase in the rate of primary outcomes, including preterm labour; pre-eclampsia; pre-eclampsia with severe features; eclampsia; gestational hypertension; fetal growth restriction; or post-partum haemorrhage. Tdap also did not increase secondary outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus; antenatal bleeding; placental abruption; premature rupture of membranes; preterm delivery; fetal distress; chorioamnionitis; or, maternal fever during or after labour. Lactation disorders was the only secondary maternal outcome with a significantly increased hazard ratio. Tdap vaccine had a protective effect on pre-eclampsia with severe features, preterm labour, preterm delivery, and antenatal bleeding. CONCLUSION: We did not detect any biologically plausible adverse maternal outcomes following Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. This study provides further assurance that Tdap administration during pregnancy is not associated with unexpected safety risks.
30039854	2019/6/5	Caffeine	Anus Diseases	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Multiple perianal ulcers due to suppositories.	We report a case of long-standing inexplicable perianal ulcers. After exclusion of an inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic origin, a thorough personal history revealed that for many years the patient had been using analgesic suppositories containing indomethacin, caffeine, and prochlorperazine dimaleate, four to five times a week, for migraine. On stopping the suppositories, there was complete healing within 12 weeks. We hypothesize that vasoconstriction and vascular damage were the pathogenetic mechanisms behind the perianal ulcers.

An observational cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: To analyze the risk of spontaneous abortions and major birth defects in pregnancies of women treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) during the first trimester. STUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort study of prospectively ascertained pregnancies from the German Embryotox pharmacovigilance institute. Pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to ACEIs during the first trimester were compared with pregnancies without antihypertensive treatment. In a sensitivity analysis, ACEI exposed hypertensive women were compared with hypertensive women on methyldopa. RESULTS: The risk of spontaneous abortion among 329 ACEI exposed women was not increased compared to 654 women without antihypertensive treatment (adjusted hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-1.92), whereas the risk for major birth defects (14/255; 5.5% vs. 19/567; 3.4%) was significantly increased (adjusted odds ratio 2.41, 95% CI 1.07-5.43). In contrast, birth defect rates were not significantly different between hypertensive women on ACEIs and hypertensive women on methyldopa. In addition, we did not observe a distinct pattern of birth defects among retrospectively ascertained pregnancies after ACEI exposure during the first trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Women with hypertension treated with ACEIs in early pregnancy are at higher risk for major birth defects, which may be explained by other factors associated with maternal hypertension. Women (inadvertently) exposed during early pregnancy may be reassured and treatment switched to antihypertensive drugs recommended for pregnancy.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify reports made to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), create a demographic of patient reports, and examine the cluster of symptoms to correlate consistency of postfinasteride syndrome (PFS) complaints. PFS is a provisional diagnosis encompassing a cluster of sexual, physical, and psychological and/or neurologic symptoms associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use that emerge or continue after discontinuation of medication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FAERS dataset of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors from April 2011 to October 2014 was obtained. Each FAERS report had 16 categories for completion, but not every report was fully completed. Statistical analysis compared variables of interest between the 2 doses of finasteride (1 mg vs 5 mg). RESULTS: From FAERS, 2048 monotherapy cases were identified: 1581 of finasteride 1 mg, 240 of finasteride 5 mg, and 226 of unreported doses. Possibly related to labeling changes, from 2011 to 2014, there was a significant increase in adverse events (AEs) reported involving 1 mg dosing. Finasteride use was reported with many sexual AEs including diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory complaints. Other common AEs included dermatologic, metabolic, and psychological and/or neurologic complaints. There were more AE reports with the 1 mg dose than the 5 mg dose. One case of dutasteride reported back pain, not generally attributed to PFS. CONCLUSION: FAERS data suggests that finasteride exposure is reported with a diverse collection of symptoms, particularly in younger men on 1 mg dosage compared to older men on 5 mg. Many of these complaints fall well out of the realm of previously established AEs from long-term controlled studies.
29036361	2019/8/6	Docetaxel	Chronic Pain	Journal Article_and_Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	1	1	0	0	0	Chronic Pain and Neuropathy Following Adjuvant Chemotherapy.	OBJECTIVE: To determine symptoms and characteristics of chronic sensory neuropathy in patients treated with oxaliplatin and docetaxel, including patterns of somatosensory abnormalities, pain descriptors, and psychological functioning. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: A chronic pain research center. SUBJECTS: Thirty-eight patients with chronic peripheral pain and/or dysesthesia following chemotherapy. METHODS: Sensory profiles, psychological functioning, and quality of life were assessed using standardized questionnaires. In addition, standardized quantitative sensory testing and nerve conduction studies were carried out. RESULTS: The sensory profiles and clinical symptoms were very similar in the two groups. Pricking, numbness, and burning were common descriptors in both groups, and the predominant finding was sensory loss to A beta-mediated sensory modalities with decreased mechanical and vibration detection thresholds. A high frequency of abnormalities in thermal sensory limen and the presence of paradoxical heat sensation seem to be sensitive markers of small fiber loss. Both groups had mainly sensory, axonal large fiber or mixed fiber polyneuropathy, which tended to be most severe in the oxaliplatin group. CONCLUSIONS: Both oxaliplatin-induced and docetaxel-induced polyneuropathies represent a significant problem that affects the daily life of the patients. Our results, defining the somatosensory phenotype, can improve the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms useful for future studies in the tailored treatment of prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and pain.

A 56-year-old female who was diagnosed with acute calculous cholecystitis received intravenous administration of cefmetazole (CMZ) from the day of admission; she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy on the 13th hospital day. She was referred to our department because of hematuria that persisted for 3 days and progressive anemia on the day after the surgery. Laboratory data showed the following results: hemoglobin (Hb) level, 6.8 g/dl; reticulocyte count, 3.4%; serum lactate dehydrogenase, 1,505 IU/l; serum creatinine, 1.1 mg/dl; and undetectable haptoglobin. The direct globulin test showed that the patient was positive for IgG. Thus, drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) was considered. All drugs, including CMZ, were immediately discontinued, and steroid was administered. The signs of hemolysis began to subside 3 days after the initiation of steroid therapy, and the administration of steroid was discontinued on the 5th day of the treatment. The patient's Hb level gradually increased, and the direct globulin test showed that the patient was negative for IgG on the 21st day from the onset of hematuria. Antibodies against CMZ-coated red blood cells were observed in the serum preserved at the onset of hemolysis. DIIHA is a rare but life-threatening disease. Immediate discontinuation of any suspected drugs and the initiation of steroid therapy as necessary are important in cases wherein DIIHA is suspected.

BACKGROUND: Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on second-generation antidepressants (SGAs). OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950- ), Embase (1974- ), PsycINFO (1967- ) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non-randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi(2) statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I(2) statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots.We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates.Overall, moderate-quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate-quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low-quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively.We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high-risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences.Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.
30689109	2019/5/7	Silicon Dioxide	Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma	Journal Article	1	0	0	0	0	A possible role of biogenic silica in esophageal cancer in North China?	Certain areas in North China have the highest incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the world, which has not seen convincing explanation by any risk factor yet. Biogenic silica in millet bran was linked to ESCC in the early 1980s but the hypothesis was largely dismissed because of the lack of geographic correlation between millet consumption and ESCC. Later epidemiological studies disclosed the linkage of wheat consumption in North China to ESCC instead. Now, we hypothesize silica phytoliths (silicified bodies that have definite shapes) from wheat chaff are a major etiologic factor of ESCC in this region. This hypothesis is supported by the potentially high abundance of silica phytoliths on the bracts of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in North China due to favorable Si-accumulation genotype, arid climate, and siallitic soil with bioavailable Si. These silica phytoliths can contaminate wheat flour and cause repeated local injuries in the esophagus and stimulate proliferation by providing anchorage.
30508887	2019/1/8	Crizotinib	Exanthema	Case Reports_and_Journal Article	1	0	0	1	0	Treatment of severe rash caused by crizotinib with both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine: Two case reports and literature review.	RATIONALE: Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common pathologic pattern of lung cancer. During the past decades, a number of targeted agents have been explored to treat advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Recently, Crizotinib, the antagonist of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has been widely used in ALK-rearranged lung cancer treatment. Crizotinib is generally well tolerated while its most frequent adverse events include visual disorders, gastrointestinal disturbances, cardiac and endocrine abnormalities. Rash caused by crizotinib is rarely seen, and there are few case reports of severe rash caused by crizotinib. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSES: Here we report cases of an 81-year-old man and a 66-year-old woman with ALK-rearranged advanced lung adenocarcinoma. When patients came to our department, they both had crizotinib-induced severe rash. INTERVENTIONS: Crizotinib was initiated as the 1st-line treatment without other therapies. We treated severe rash with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy called Zhiyang Pingfu liquid along with Western medicine. Zhiyang Pingfu liquid consists of Scutellaria baicalensis 20 g, Portulaca oleracea 30 g, Cortex Dictamni 30 g, Sophora flavescens 30 g, and other substances. Western medicine includes Minocycline hydrochloride tablets and Aprepitant capsules. OUTCOMES: Both patients achieved a partial response when treated with crizotinib, and suffered from severe rash. With Zhiyang Pingfu liquid and Western medicine, their rash gradually disappeared with no sign of cancer progression. Also the male patient did not relieve after taking only antibiotics (standard therapy) and anti-allergic medicine. LESSONS: Despite the dramatic benefit of crizotinib for patients with ALK rearrangement, crizotinib-induced severe rash needs to be dealt with caution. This is the 1st case in which TCM and Western medicine are used to successfully treat crizotinib-induced severe rash. The mechanism of crizotinib-induced rash deserves further attention in future research.

Patients taking antidepressants, including Clomipramine (CLP), have an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture. However, the effects of CLP on bone metabolism are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that WT mice treated with CLP for 2 weeks had significantly reduced trabecular bone volume and cortical bone thickness, associated with increased osteoclast (OC) numbers, but had no change in osteoblast numbers or bone formation rate. Bone marrow cells from CLP-treated mice had normal OC precursor frequency, but formed significantly more OCs when they were cultured with RANKL and M-CSF. CLP promoted OC formation and bone resorption and expression of OC-associated genes. CLP-induced bone loss was prevented by Zoledronic acid. At the molecular level, CLP inhibited the activity of the ubiquitin E3 ligase Itch. CLP did not promote OC formation from bone marrow cells of Itch-/- mice in vitro nor induce bone loss in Itch-/- mice. Our findings indicate that CLP causes bone loss by enhancing Itch-mediated osteoclastogenesis, which was prevented by Zoledronic acid. Thus, anti-resorptive therapy could be used to prevent bone loss in patients taking antidepressants, such as CLP.

The impacts of gonadtropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists on thyroid function have long been observed and the conclusions were controversial. We here reported three cases of transient hyperthyroidisms after triptorelin therapy. The three patients showed decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), with or without elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) 2 weeks after injection of triptorelin. Thyroid-specific autoantibody assays showed antithyroid microsome autoantibody (TMAb) and (or) antithyroglobulin autoantibody (TgAb) were positive in two patients while and antithyrotropin receptor autoantibody (TRAb) were negative in all three cases. One patient with all thyroid-specific autoantibodies negative showed enlarged thyroid in thyroid ultrasound scanning. Only mild symptoms of hyperthyroidism presented in one patient. Four weeks after triptorelin injection, thyroid function returned to normal in all three patients. These observations indicated transient hyperthyroidism due to thyroid destruction in patients receive triptorelin therapy. The hyperthyroidism was most possibly due to onset of the autoimmune thyroiditis, emphasizing monitoring thyroid function during triptorelin treatment in females.

AIMS: To test the hypothesis that, as well as lowering weight and increasing plasma triglyceride (TG) levels and hepatic fat compared with insulin glargine (GL) in patients with type 1 diabetes, the attenuated peripheral effects of basal insulin peglispro (BIL) may include increased free fatty acid flux to the liver, causing increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG secretion and lipid oxidation, and decreased TG adipose tissue deposition. METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study, 14 patients with type 1 diabetes received once-daily, individualized, stable BIL or GL doses for 3 weeks. Palmitate flux was assessed using [9,10-(3) H]palmitate infusion. VLDL-TG secretion, clearance and oxidation rate were assessed using primed-constant infusion of ex vivo labelled [1-(14) C]VLDL-TG, while VLDL-TG storage rate was assessed using [9,10-(3) H]VLDL-TG bolus injection. RESULTS: The VLDL-TG concentration and secretion rate, and palmitate flux were statistically significantly higher during BIL than during GL treatment (58%, 51% and 35%, respectively). The ratios of least squares (LS) geometric means for VLDL-TG clearance and oxidation were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72, 1.17) and 1.31 (95% CI 0.91, 1.90), respectively. The difference in LS means for VLDL-TG storage rate was -0.36 (95% CI -0.83, 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: BIL-treated patients had higher effective lipolysis, VLDL-TG secretion and VLDL-TG concentration compared with GL-treated patients, explaining the increased plasma TG concentrations reported previously. Data support attenuated effects of BIL on lipolysis, in addition to the recently described hepato-preferential glucodynamic effects.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a possible case of capecitabine-induced myopericarditis in a patient at the Cardio-Oncology Clinic in Calgary, AB. DESIGN: A literature search and adverse drug reaction assessment with the Naranjo tool was conducted. RESULTS: A 39-year-old male with recurrent locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma presented two days after adjuvant treatment with capecitabine and oxaliplatin complaining of intermittent, severe interscapular pain. Based on symptoms, laboratory investigations, and imaging, the patient was diagnosed with acute myopericarditis. Management included aspirin, colchicine, and discontinuing adjuvant chemotherapy. A literature review revealed one case report of capecitabine-induced myopericarditis; however, more data were found regarding the cardiotoxicity of fluorouracil, for which capecitabine is a pro-drug. No case reports were found for oxaliplatin. CONCLUSION: Due to the timeline of capecitabine administration, symptom onset, and improvement upon medication discontinuation, capecitabine is the probable cause of the myopericarditis. Although rare, it is important to consider the possibility of myopericarditis in patients receiving a fluoropyrimidine who present with cardiovascular symptoms.
30592879	2019/4/19	Aluminum Oxide	Eczema	Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	[Using of specialized food for the workers with skin occupational eczema of perlite production].	The research was conducted with participation of the perlite production workers with professional eczema (165 people in the main group and 152 from the control group without skin pathology). The effectiveness of the use of a specialized prophylactic food in the diet of workers was assessed on the basis of the study of the dynamics of the indicators of nutritional and clinical status. Inclusion of kissel, containing pectin, vitamin A (300% from RDA), vitamin E and zinc (40% from RDA), biologically active substances of plant origin in the diet of the examined against the background of the course of complex therapy, has resulted in a positive influence on individual laboratory values, demonstrating the optimization of metabolic processes, which characterize the pathogenesis of skin inflammation. Thus, the concentration of ascorbic acid in blood serum statistically significant (p<0.05) increased by 30.0%, tocopherol - by 36.3%, carotenoids - by 27.3%, phosphorus - by 28.9%, calcium level elevated by 16.3% (p<0.10). There was a decrease in the level of MDA in blood serum by 12.3% (p<0.05) and an increase in catalase activity by 12.2% (p>0.05). There was a tendency to reduce itching, infiltration, erythematous and eczematous manifestations of the disease. The data obtained make it possible to consider the use of a specialized food product of dietary preventive nutrition by workers in pearlite production as a mean to enhance the body's adaptive reserves and to prevent the occurrence, progression and development of occupational skin diseases (eczema) in the workplace.

OBJECTIVE: The poor compliance to treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infected patients is well-known. We evaluated the efficacy of daily single-dose triple therapy as compared to conventional triple therapy on patient compliance and eradication of H. pylori infection. METHODS: In the study group, 105 patients received esomeprazole 40 mg, tinidazole 1 g, and levofloxacin 500 mg once-daily for 14 days. One hundred and seven patients in the control group received lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice-daily for 14 days. Four weeks after completing therapy, urea breath test was performed to assess the eradication of H. pylori infection. RESULTS: The eradication rates by intention-to-treat analysis were 86% and 90.2% and by per-protocol analyses were 90.5% and 95.3% in the control and study groups, respectively, with no significant differences. Drug compliance was significantly better in the study group compared to the control group (p = 0.04). Overall, 44.7% of the patients in the study and 47.6% in the control groups had at least one adverse event. The most common adverse event was the dysgeusia in both the groups. The occurrence of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting was significantly higher in the control group and that of arthralgia was higher in the study group. The presence of periodontal disease and drug compliance was independently associated with treatment failure. CONCLUSION: The use of single-dose PPI-based triple therapy improves drug compliance and eradication rate to standard PPI-based triple therapy. Presence of periodontal disease and drug compliance had negative influence on the eradication rate. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02711176 ᅟ ᅟ.

AIMS: To assess the safety and efficacy of monotherapy with once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide vs sitagliptin in Japanese people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: In this phase IIIa randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicentre trial, Japanese adults with T2D treated with diet and exercise only or oral antidiabetic drug monotherapy (washed out during the run-in period) received once-weekly s.c. semaglutide (0.5 or 1.0 mg) or once-daily oral sitagliptin 100 mg. The primary endpoint was number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) after 30 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, 308 participants were randomized and exposed to treatment, with similar baseline characteristics across the groups. In total, 2.9% of participants in both the semaglutide 0.5 mg and the sitagliptin group prematurely discontinued treatment, compared with 14.7% in the semaglutide 1.0 mg group. The majority of discontinuations in the semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg groups were attributable to adverse events (AEs). More TEAEs were reported in semaglutide- vs sitagliptin-treated participants (74.8%, 71.6% and 66.0% in the semaglutide 0.5 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg and sitagliptin groups, respectively). AEs were mainly mild to moderate. Gastrointestinal AEs, most frequently reported with semaglutide, diminished in frequency over time. The mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c [baseline 8.1%]) decreased by 1.9% and 2.2% with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg, respectively, vs 0.7% with sitagliptin (estimated treatment difference [ETD] vs sitagliptin -1.13%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.32; -0.94, and -1.44%, 95% CI -1.63; -1.24; both P < .0001). Body weight (baseline 69.3 kg) was reduced by 2.2 and 3.9 kg with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg, respectively (ETD -2.22 kg, 95% CI -3.02; -1.42 and -3.88 kg, 95% CI -4.70; -3.07; both P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese people with T2D, more TEAEs were reported with semaglutide than with sitagliptin; however, the semaglutide safety profile was similar to that of other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide significantly reduced HbA1c and body weight compared with sitagliptin.

Humans may be exposed to pesticides such as fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides, during occupational and non-occupational activities. Pesticides could be related to cancer development mainly because of their effects on the endocrine and immune systems and their cumulative effect. The present review evaluated in current literature evidence of an association between exposure to pesticides and the occurrence of head and neck cancer (HNC). A literature search for cohort studies was conducted in the PubMed, Web of science, and Cochrane databases. Methodological quality of each study was rated with the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) checklist. One thousand one hundred and thirty-two studies were identified. Thirty-two were included. Most of the studies found addressed occupational exposure to pesticides and were conducted in Europe and North America. Eleven high-quality studies were found. Most of them found no association between exposure to pesticides and increased risk of HNC. Two studies found some evidence of a positive association between pesticide (malathion and atrazine) exposure and thyroid cancer. The literature review does not support a clear evidence for association between pesticides exposure and HNC. Only limited evidence points to a positive association between exposure to some pesticides and thyroid cancer. Further standardized studies based on appropriate designs are required to clarify the effect of pesticides on the genesis of HNC, considering dose, length of exposure, and type of pesticide.

Humans may be exposed to pesticides such as fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides, during occupational and non-occupational activities. Pesticides could be related to cancer development mainly because of their effects on the endocrine and immune systems and their cumulative effect. The present review evaluated in current literature evidence of an association between exposure to pesticides and the occurrence of head and neck cancer (HNC). A literature search for cohort studies was conducted in the PubMed, Web of science, and Cochrane databases. Methodological quality of each study was rated with the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) checklist. One thousand one hundred and thirty-two studies were identified. Thirty-two were included. Most of the studies found addressed occupational exposure to pesticides and were conducted in Europe and North America. Eleven high-quality studies were found. Most of them found no association between exposure to pesticides and increased risk of HNC. Two studies found some evidence of a positive association between pesticide (malathion and atrazine) exposure and thyroid cancer. The literature review does not support a clear evidence for association between pesticides exposure and HNC. Only limited evidence points to a positive association between exposure to some pesticides and thyroid cancer. Further standardized studies based on appropriate designs are required to clarify the effect of pesticides on the genesis of HNC, considering dose, length of exposure, and type of pesticide.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder associated with antipsychotic treatment. Because of the serious and potentially irreversible nature of TD, accurate diagnosis is crucial. However, diagnosing TD can be challenging, since the subtle and often fluctuating symptoms can be easily mistaken for symptoms of mental illness or other side effects. Although the risk of developing TD in relation to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics is lower than that associated with first-generation antipsychotics, the risk still exists and may be greater than once believed. Clinicians prescribe antipsychotics for a variety of illnesses and may underestimate the possibility of a patient developing TD, thus missing early signs of the disorder. In this ACADEMIC HIGHLIGHTS, experts review the prevalence, phenomenology, risk factors, and impact of TD, illustrated by case examples, and provide valuable clinical information to guide early recognition and accurate diagnosis.

Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are well-known complications that can occur after prothrombin complex concentrate therapy. However, acute myocardial infarction is a very rare but potentially life-threatening complication that was exclusively described in patients with bleeding disorders who received chronic and recurrent concentrate infusions. We report the case of a 70 year-old male patient with cholangiocarcinoma who was admitted to our hospital with worsening fatigue and weakness. His stay was complicated by uncontrolled bleeding secondary to rivaroxaban use and advanced liver disease. By the end of the prothrombin complex concentrate infusion used to reverse his coagulopathy, patient developed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock and passed away. This is the first reported case of acute myocardial infarction that occurs in a patient without hemophilia and after the first prothrombin complex concentrate infusion.

28676023	2019/2/5	Sunitinib	Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular	Journal Article	1	1	0	0	0	Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Inhibitor Therapy and Cardiovascular and Renal Damage in Renal Cell Carcinoma.	BACKGROUND: Sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is approved for first and second line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Knowledge on the effects of sunitinib on cardiovascular (CV) risk and renal damage is limited. AIM: To evaluate possible renal and CV damage in patients with RCC treated with sunitinib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic RCC treated with sunitinib were enrolled. This population was evaluated before starting treatment (T0) and after 3 months (T1). Laboratory and instrumental parameters, including interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were recorded before and after treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (13 female, 19 male, mean age 62.7+/-9.9 years) were enrolled. We observed overtime, a significant reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p=0.01), hemoglobin (Hb) (p=0.04) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-VitD) (p=0.002), in association with a significant increase in serum phosphorus (p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p<0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p<0.001), IVS (p=0.03) and proteinuria (p<0.001), while we showed no significant differences in glycosuria, phosphaturia, serum uric acid, intact parathormone, and LVMI. CONCLUSION: We observed the development of renal damage and worsening of CV indices in patients treated with sunitinib. We suggest to consider a careful assessment of renal function and CV risk factors, before initiation and during administration of this drug.

Mitotane is a cytostatic antineoplastic agent that is used in the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma and Cushing's syndrome. The commonly reported side effects associated with mitotane are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, decreased memory, rash, gynaecomastia, arthralgias and leucopenia. We present a case of a 68-year-old female who developed gradual dyspnoea concurrent with the use of mitotane for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge and literate review, this is the first reported case of dyspnoea associated with the use of this medication. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness about this uncommon adverse effect of mitotane that may have gone unrecognised on postmarketing surveillance because of under-reporting, lack of case follow-up or other comorbidities masking shortness of breath.

Albendazole is often used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of echinococcal infection to reduce cyst viability before and prevent recurrence after surgical treatment. In this report, we present a 38-year-old Iraqi woman with Echinococcus initiated on albendazole therapy who developed acute liver failure 6 weeks after treatment. Investigation for common viral and autoimmune causes of liver injury was unremarkable, and a liver biopsy revealed changes consistent with severe, drug-induced liver injury. Despite discontinuation of albendazole, liver function continued to deteriorate, prompting rescue with an orthotopic liver transplant. Often used perioperatively in the management of Echinococcus infection, albendazole can induce idiosyncratic severe liver injury, mandating close monitoring for hepatotoxicity.

BACKGROUND: Submucosal hematoma has never been associated with caustic injuries. Long-term follow-up of patients who ingested ammonia is not well known and ammonia ingestion is rare. METHODS: In a Single-center observational study, prospective data were collected from 2009 to 2013, in patients over the age of 14 years old referred for ammonia ingestion. The emergency and follow-up endoscopic data and the outcome were reported. RESULTS: Ammonia ingestion occurred in 43 patients. Submucosal hematoma of the gastric wall was a distinctive endoscopic sign observed in 15 (34.8%) cases. Oropharyngeal lesions were present in 30 (69.8%) patients, which was associated with ingestion with suicidal intent in 18 cases. Mild and severe endoscopic lesions (grade IIB to IIIB) were found in 16 (37.2%) cases with 10 (23.3%) cases presenting submucosal hematoma at initial endoscopy. A complete spontaneous gastric healing was frequently observed in 36 (83.7%) cases. In 11 cases with submucosal hematoma, a favourable outcome was observed with a medical treatment, however 6 of these patients had severe endoscopic lesions initially. CONCLUSIONS: Submucosal hematoma of the gastric wall is an endoscopic sign occurring frequently in ammonia ingestion. Submucosal hematoma should be distinguished from necrosis in order to avoid false misclassification in favour of more severe lesions, which would lead to an abusive surgery.

The aim of study was to review the status of arterial pH, pO(2) and pCO(2) under general anesthesias in dependence on the light-dark (LD) cycle in spontaneously breathing rats. The experiments were performed using three- to four-month-old pentobarbital(P)-, ketamine/xylazine(K/X)- and zoletil(Z)-anesthetized female Wistar rats after a four-week adaptation to an LD cycle (12 h light:12 h dark). The animals were divided into three experimental groups according to the anesthetic agent used: P (light n=11; dark n=8); K/X (light n=13; dark n=11); and Z (light n=18; dark n=26). pH and blood gases from arterial blood were analyzed. In P anesthesia, LD differences in pH, pO(2), and pCO(2) were eliminated. In K/X anesthesia, parameters showed significant LD differences. In Z anesthesia, LD differences were detected for pH and pO(2) only. Acidosis, hypoxia, and hypercapnia have been reported for all types of anesthesia during the light period. In the dark period, except for P anesthesia, the environment was more stable and values fluctuated within normal ranges. From a chronobiological perspective, P anesthesia was not the most appropriate type of anesthesia in these rat experiments. It eliminated LD differences, and also produced a more acidic environment and more pronounced hypercapnia than K/X and Z anesthesias.

The predominant saturated fatty acids (SFA) in human diets are lauric acid (LA, C12:0), myristic acid (MA, C14:0), palmitic acid (PA, C16:0) and stearic acid (SA, C18:0). The aim of this study was to investigate whether diets containing individual SFA together with excess simple carbohydrates induce osteoarthritis (OA)-like changes in knee joints and signs of metabolic syndrome in rats. Rats were given either a corn starch diet or a diet composed of simple carbohydrates together with 20% LA, MA, PA, SA or beef tallow for 16 weeks. Rats fed beef tallow, SA, MA or PA diets developed signs of metabolic syndrome, and also exhibited cartilage degradation and subchondral bone changes similar to OA. In contrast, replacement of beef tallow with LA decreased signs of metabolic syndrome together with decreased cartilage degradation. Furthermore, PA and SA but not LA increased release of matrix sulphated proteoglycans in cultures of bovine cartilage explants or human chondrocytes. In conclusion, we have shown that longer-chain dietary SFA in rats induce both metabolic syndrome and OA-like knee changes. Thus, diets containing SFA are strongly relevant to the development or prevention of both OA and metabolic syndrome.

30726105	2019/8/15	Tylosin	Ventricular Dysfunction, Left	Journal Article	0	0	0	0	0	Protective effect of ghrelin against tilmicosin-induced left ventricular dysfunction in rats.	This study was conducted to investigate the possible protective effects of ghrelin against tilmicosin-induced acute ventricular dysfunction in rats. Forty adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 equal groups: control, ghrelin, tilmicosin, and ghrelin + tilmicosin. The left ventricular structural and functional parameters together with cardiac biomarker levels were evaluated. The results showed that tilmicosin treatment alone significantly decreased the left ventricular fractional shortening, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular stroke volume, and cardiac output when compared with control group. In addition, tilmicosin led to a significant increase in left ventricular internal dimension in systole and left ventricular fractional end-systolic volume. At the same time, serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase-myocardial B fraction levels were significantly increased in tilmicosin-treated group when compared with control group. However, ghrelin pretreatment significantly prevented the left ventricular internal dimension in systole, left ventricular fractional end-systolic volume, left ventricular stroke volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular fractional shortening, and cardiac output changes caused by tilmicosin. Moreover, ghrelin pretreatment could reduce significantly serum lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase-myocardial B fraction levels. These data indicated that ghrelin treatment may provide a protective effect against tilmicosin-induced left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Two jaguars were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and isoflurane. Arterial blood samples analyzed shortly after darting revealed no abnormalities. Samples analyzed 2 and 1.5 hr after darting revealed moderate hyperkalemia in both animals (6.8 and 6.2 mEq/L, respectively). Shortly after hyperkalemia was recognized, one jaguar developed electrocardiographic abnormalities (sinoventricular rhythm and widened QRS complexes), and a few minutes later, suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitation with chest compressions, intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, and epinephrine was successful, and autonomous breathing and circulation resumed within a few minutes. Anesthesia-related hyperkalemia has been reported in a variety of large felids but has not been reported previously in jaguars. In all reports, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists were used as part of the immobilization protocol. Due to the presumptively high incidence and mortality caused by this complication, frequent monitoring of electrolyte concentrations and prompt treatment of hyperkalemia is recommended when anesthetizing large felids, including jaguars.

BACKGROUND: Certolizumab pegol is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike other monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab and adalimumab, certolizumab does not contain an Fc fraction and hence does not induce complement activation. In this report, we describe the case of a patient with thrombotic microangiopathy caused due to certolizumab pegol, with a brief description about the pathophysiological approach to thrombotic microangiopathy. CASE REPORT: A-39-year-old man suffering from ankylosing spondylitis for the past 10 years presented with fatigue. He had been on certolizumab pegol treatment for 6 months, starting with 400 and 200 mg every 2 weeks. He had significant nonimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia without a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Schistocytes were observed in more than 10% of the erythrocytes per field. Plasma exchange along with corticosteroid treatment was started. There was a dramatic improvement within a week, and after 10 sessions of plasma exchange, the patient was discharged on corticosteroids with a tapering plan. ADAMTS13 enzyme activity was determined to be normal. CONCLUSION: The development of drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy may be either immune-mediated or dose-dependent toxicity-mediated Anti-drug antibodies and their immunological aspects are still unclear and yet to be elucidated.

BACKGROUND: Besides stricture formation, diminished esophageal motility after caustic esophageal burns also plays a role in the deterioration of the clinical course. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of caustic burn on the esophageal contractions and the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on these changes. METHODS: Twenty-one Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups [Sham operation (n = 8), caustic esophageal burn with NaOH (n = 6), PRP treatment after caustic burn (n = 7)]. After 3 weeks, esophagectomy was performed and contractions and EFS responses were evaluated in the organ bath. RESULTS: KCl- and acetylcholine-induced responses were reduced in the Burn group, but increased in Sham and PRP groups (p < 0.05). EFS responses were higher in Burn group compared to the other groups. Response with L-arginine was increased in Burn group, but decreased in PRP group. There was more decrease in the contraction in Sham and PRP groups compared to the Burn group after SNP (sodium nitroprusside) incubation (p < 0.05). L-NAME (Nomega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) did not change the EFS responses in the Burn group, but EFS responses were decreased significantly in Sham and PRP groups (p < 0.05). EFS responses were decreased in all groups, but more in the Sham and PRP groups after Y-27632 (Rho-kinase inhibitor) incubation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we demonstrated that both cholinergic and non-adrenergic non-cholinergic mechanisms are responsible for the altered motility in corrosive esophageal injury. Our results suggest that PRP treatment may be helpful in regulating the esophageal motility and decreasing altered contractions in corrosive burns. This effect may also contribute to the reduction of stricture formation, especially by reducing inappropriate contractions of the esophageal wall during the post-burn healing phase.

A 79-year old man was diagnosed with an episode of hypomania during the use of fluticasone intranasal spray. After discontinuation the patient recovered completely. Patients with oral corticosteroid treatment have an increased risk of developing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. This case-report shows that adverse systemic effects can also occur when using local corticosteroids. While the incidence of systemic side effects after using local treatment is not well known, there are various case reports. It is advised to be cautious when using multiple corticosteroids simultaneously due to the additive effect, when treating risk groups and when treating patients with a history of psychiatric disease.

Eosinophilic colitis is a rare clinical condition that belongs to the group of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Its occurrence can be primary or secondary to infection, medications, or autoimmune/hematological conditions. We present a case of a young female adult with severe chronic fatigue syndrome, widespread chronic pain, including functional abdominal pain, who developed severe eosinophilic colitis following successive treatments with gabapentin and pregabalin. On both occasions, symptoms manifested as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and eosinophilia and improved upon discontinuation of the medications. Magnetic resonance imaging of the small bowel demonstrated an ascending colon colitis, and endoscopic investigations confirmed florid colitis mainly in the ascending colon with biopsies demonstrating a dense eosinophilic infiltrate with micro-abscesses. Serum eosinophil counts correlated well with the timing of the agents' administration. There was no other organ involvement. Symptoms improved upon discontinuation of the drugs and steroid administration. Eosinophilic colitis is an exceptionally rare entity and its mechanism of action is still unclear. Suspicion of eosinophilic colitis should be raised if a patient presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and peripheral eosinophilia following treatment with pregabalin or gabapentin.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the small bowel demonstrated an ascending colon colitis, and endoscopic investigations confirmed florid colitis mainly in the ascending colon with biopsies demonstrating a dense eosinophilic infiltrate with micro-abscesses. Serum eosinophil counts correlated well with the timing of the agents' administration. There was no other organ involvement. Symptoms improved upon discontinuation of the drugs and steroid administration. Eosinophilic colitis is an exceptionally rare entity and its mechanism of action is still unclear. Suspicion of eosinophilic colitis should be raised if a patient presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and peripheral eosinophilia following treatment with pregabalin or gabapentin.
