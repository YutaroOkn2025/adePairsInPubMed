29476878	Betamethasone	Atrophy	0	1	0	0		Low systemic exposure and calcemic effect of calcipotriol/betamethasone ointment in rats with imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis.	Vitamin D(3) (VD(3)) analogues-containing ointments are known to occasionally cause hypercalcemia in psoriasis patients, and the frequency of hypercalcemia is suggested to vary based on the VD(3) analogue used. In this study, to address the differences in calcemic effects of VD(3)-containing ointments, the calcemic effects of marketed VD(3)-containing ointments, including calcipotriol (Cal), maxacalcitol (Max), tacalcitol (Tac), calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BDP) and maxacalcitol/betamethasone butyrate propionate (Max/BBP) ointments, were evaluated in a rat model of imiquimod-induced dermatitis. The topical application of Tac, Max and Max/BBP ointments, but not Cal and Cal/BDP ointments, to the imiquimod-induced skin lesions significantly induced an increase in the serum calcium level compared with the vaseline-treated group. Calcemic effect of VD(3) analogues in rats treated with VD(3)-containing ointments was analyzed by evaluating the expression of vitamin D receptor target genes, such as Cyp24a1, Trpv5 and CalbindinD28k, in the intestine and kidney. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the renal and intestinal Cyp24a1 expressions in the Cal- and Cal/BDP-treated groups were significantly lower than those in the Tac-, Max- and Max/BBP-treated groups, suggesting that systemic exposure of VD(3) analogues in the Cal- and Cal/BDP-treated groups were lower than those in the other ointment-treated groups. In addition, the renal Trpv5 and CalbindinD28k expressions, calcium-transporting genes, were increased in the Max- and Max/BBP-treated groups compared with the Cal- and Cal/BDP-treated groups. Thus, because of the low systemic exposure of VD(3) analogues, Cal and Cal/BDP ointments have lower calcemic effect than the other VD(3)-containing ointments in rats with psoriasis-like dermatitis.

30343188	Tetanus Toxoid	Myocarditis	1	1	1	1	1.0	A case of biopsy-proven eosinophilic myocarditis related to tetanus toxoid immunization.	Vaccine-associated myocarditis is an extremely rare, yet potentially lethal disease, which requires early diagnosis and prompt treatment. However, its pathogenesis remains elusive. We report the first case of biopsy-proven eosinophilic myocarditis related to tetanus toxoid immunization, with unique histopathologic findings, characterized by perivascular eosinophilic infiltrates with myocyte necrosis and abundant interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates with myocyte necrosis, separately. A systemic high-dose corticosteroid treatment had a dramatic beneficial effect on hemodynamic instability and resulted in complete recovery. This case highlights the value of endomyocardial biopsy in establishing a definite diagnosis and understanding the pathogenesis of vaccine-associated myocarditis.
30138389	Aspirin	Intracranial Hemorrhages	1	1	0	0	0.0	Risk of intracranial hemorrhage (RICH) in users of oral antithrombotic drugs: Nationwide pharmacoepidemiological study.	BACKGROUND: The risks of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) associated with antithrombotic drugs outside clinical trials are gaining increased attention. The aim of this nationwide study was to investigate the risk of ICH requiring hospital admission in users of antithrombotic drugs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data from the Norwegian Patient Registry and Norwegian Prescription Database were linked on an individual level. The primary outcome was incidence rates of ICH associated with use of antithrombotic drugs. Secondary endpoints were risk of ICH and fatal outcome following ICH assessed by Cox models. Among 3,131,270 individuals >/=18 years old observed from 2008 through 2014, there were 729,818 users of antithrombotic medications and 22,111 ICH hospitalizations. Annual crude ICH rates per 100 person-years were 0.076 (95% CI, 0.075-0.077) in non-users and 0.30 (95% CI, 0.30-0.31) in users of antithrombotic medication, with the highest age and sex adjusted rates observed for aspirin-dipyridamole plus clopidogrel (0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69), rivaroxaban plus aspirin (0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.56), warfarin plus aspirin (0.34; 95% CI, 0.26-0.43), and warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (0.33; 95% CI, 0.073-0.60). With no antithrombotic medication as reference, the highest adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for ICH were observed for aspirin-dypiridamole plus clopidogrel (6.29; 95% CI 3.71-10.7), warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (4.38; 95% CI 2.71-7.09), rivaroxaban plus aspirin (3.82; 95% CI, 2.46-5.95), and warfarin plus aspirin (3.40; 95% CI, 2.99-3.86). All antithrombotic medication regimens were associated with an increased risk of ICH, except dabigatran monotherapy (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.88-1.65) and dabigatran plus aspirin (HR 1.79; 95% CI, 0.96-3.34). Fatal outcome within 90 days was more common in users (2,603 of 8,055) than non-users (3,228 of 14,056) of antithrombotic medication (32.3% vs 23.0%, p<0.001), and was associated with use of warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (HR 2.89; 95% CI, 1.49-5.60), warfarin plus aspirin (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.68), aspirin plus clopidogrel (HR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61), and warfarin (HR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.31). Increased one-year mortality was observed in users of antithrombotic medication following hemorrhagic stroke, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic ICH (all p<0.001). Limitations include those inherent to observational studies including the inability to make causal inferences, certain assumptions regarding drug exposure, and the possibility of residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world incidence rates and risks of ICH were generally higher than reported in randomized controlled trials. There is still major room for improvement in terms of antithrombotic medication safety (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02481011).

30138389	Rivaroxaban	Intracranial Hemorrhages	1	1	0	0	0.0	Risk of intracranial hemorrhage (RICH) in users of oral antithrombotic drugs: Nationwide pharmacoepidemiological study.	BACKGROUND: The risks of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) associated with antithrombotic drugs outside clinical trials are gaining increased attention. The aim of this nationwide study was to investigate the risk of ICH requiring hospital admission in users of antithrombotic drugs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data from the Norwegian Patient Registry and Norwegian Prescription Database were linked on an individual level. The primary outcome was incidence rates of ICH associated with use of antithrombotic drugs. Secondary endpoints were risk of ICH and fatal outcome following ICH assessed by Cox models. Among 3,131,270 individuals >/=18 years old observed from 2008 through 2014, there were 729,818 users of antithrombotic medications and 22,111 ICH hospitalizations. Annual crude ICH rates per 100 person-years were 0.076 (95% CI, 0.075-0.077) in non-users and 0.30 (95% CI, 0.30-0.31) in users of antithrombotic medication, with the highest age and sex adjusted rates observed for aspirin-dipyridamole plus clopidogrel (0.44; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69), rivaroxaban plus aspirin (0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.56), warfarin plus aspirin (0.34; 95% CI, 0.26-0.43), and warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (0.33; 95% CI, 0.073-0.60). With no antithrombotic medication as reference, the highest adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for ICH were observed for aspirin-dypiridamole plus clopidogrel (6.29; 95% CI 3.71-10.7), warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (4.38; 95% CI 2.71-7.09), rivaroxaban plus aspirin (3.82; 95% CI, 2.46-5.95), and warfarin plus aspirin (3.40; 95% CI, 2.99-3.86). All antithrombotic medication regimens were associated with an increased risk of ICH, except dabigatran monotherapy (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.88-1.65) and dabigatran plus aspirin (HR 1.79; 95% CI, 0.96-3.34). Fatal outcome within 90 days was more common in users (2,603 of 8,055) than non-users (3,228 of 14,056) of antithrombotic medication (32.3% vs 23.0%, p<0.001), and was associated with use of warfarin plus aspirin and clopidogrel (HR 2.89; 95% CI, 1.49-5.60), warfarin plus aspirin (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.11-1.68), aspirin plus clopidogrel (HR 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61), and warfarin (HR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.31). Increased one-year mortality was observed in users of antithrombotic medication following hemorrhagic stroke, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic ICH (all p<0.001). Limitations include those inherent to observational studies including the inability to make causal inferences, certain assumptions regarding drug exposure, and the possibility of residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: The real-world incidence rates and risks of ICH were generally higher than reported in randomized controlled trials. There is still major room for improvement in terms of antithrombotic medication safety (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02481011).

30007329	Azithromycin	Gastrointestinal Diseases	0	0	0	0		Treatment of Neonatal Chlamydial Conjunctivitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: With the continued high prevalence of chlamydia worldwide and high risk of transfer from mothers to their infant during delivery, a need for safe and effective therapies for infants who acquire a chlamydial infection remains. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of antibiotic treatments, including oral erythromycin, azithromycin, and trimethoprim, for neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their inception to July 14, 2017. We included randomized and nonrandomized studies that evaluated the effects of erythromycin, azithromycin, or trimethoprim in neonates with chlamydial conjunctivitis. A meta-analysis using a random-effects generic inverse-variance method was performed, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: We found 12 studies (n = 292 neonates) and were able to meta-analyze 7 studies that used erythromycin at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight per day for 14 days. The clinical and microbiological cure were 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%-100%) and 97% (95% CI, 95%-99%), respectively, and adverse gastrointestinal effects occurred in 14% (95% CI, 1%-28%) of the neonates. The microbiological cure in the study that assessed azithromycin at 20 mg/kg per day were 60% (95% CI, 27%-93%) when it was given in a single dose and 86% (95% CI, 61%-100%) when given in a 3-day course. Two studies reported compliance with treatments, and 1 study reported no pyloric stenosis events. Because of the risk of bias and the few neonates included across the studies, the certainty of evidence is low to very low. No studies assessed trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence suggests that erythromycin at 50 mg/kg per day for 14 days results in higher numbers of cure than does azithromycin, compliance and risk of pyloric stenosis related to their use for other infections in neonates will factor into treatment recommendations. More data are needed to compare these treatments directly.

29288483	Nitrofurantoin	Pulmonary Fibrosis	1	1	0	1	0.0	Spontaneous resolution of nitrofurantoin-induced chronic pulmonary toxicity presenting with respiratory failure.	Nitrofurantoin is one of the most common drugs implicated in drug-induced pulmonary toxicities, the manifestations of which range from dose-independent acute self-limiting reactions to chronic dose-dependent pathologies. The severity of these pulmonary adverse effects may range from trivial hypersensitivity reactions to extensive and irreversible lung fibrosis leading to respiratory failure and death. Symptomatic and supportive treatment in addition to discontinuation of the drug usually suffices for the management of mild reactions. Corticosteroids have been traditionally used to relieve the symptoms and hasten the resolution of pulmonary lesions in case of severe toxicities. However conclusive evidence in the form of controlled studies in favor of this routine use is lacking. We report a case of an elderly lady who presented to us in respiratory failure due to nitrofurantoin induced chronic lung disease. The patient's symptoms and blood gas abnormalities resolved spontaneously over the course of 6 months after stopping the drug. Radiological lesions including those suggestive of apparently permanent fibrosis also resolved during this time. Corticosteroids, inhalational or systemic, were not used. Spontaneous normalization of clinico-radiological features in nitrofurantoin induced chronic lung disease presenting with respiratory failure has rarely been reported previously. The related literature is also reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI), also known as congenital hyperinsulinism, has been known to go into spontaneous remission, with patients developing diabetes in later life. A temporary phase of hyperglycemia is, however, rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 16-month-old child, a known case of diazoxide responsive PHHI, presenting with mixed hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma and ketoacidosis with rhabdomyolysis while on diazoxide treatment. The patient required temporary cessation of diazoxide and initiation of insulin infusion, followed by a relapse of hypoglycemia again necessitating diazoxide therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperosmolar coma with ketoacidosis is a rare side-effect of diazoxide therapy, documented even in patients with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy.
29327400	Vitamin B 12	Nausea	0	1	0	0		A vitamin B12 conjugate of exendin-4 improves glucose tolerance without associated nausea or hypophagia in rodents.	AIMS: While pharmacological glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are FDA-approved for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, a major side effect is nausea/malaise. We recently developed a conjugate of vitamin B12 (B12) bound to the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (Ex4), which displays enhanced proteolytic stability and retention of GLP-1R agonism. Here, we evaluate whether the conjugate (B12-Ex4) can improve glucose tolerance without producing anorexia and malaise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the effects of systemic B12-Ex4 and unconjugated Ex4 on food intake and body weight change, oral glucose tolerance and nausea/malaise in male rats, and on intraperitoneal glucose tolerance in mice. To evaluate whether differences in the profile of effects of B12-Ex4 vs unconjugated Ex4 are the result of altered CNS penetrance, rats received systemic injections of fluorescein-Ex4 (Flex), Cy5-B12 or Cy5-B12-Ex4 and brain penetrance was evaluated using confocal microscopy. Uptake of systemically administered Cy5-B12-Ex4 in insulin-containing pancreatic beta cells was also examined. RESULTS: B12-Ex4 conjugate improves glucose tolerance, but does not elicit the malaise and anorexia produced by unconjugated Ex4. While Flex robustly penetrates into the brain (dorsal vagal complex, paraventricular hypothalamus), Cy5-B12 and Cy5-B12-Ex4 fluorescence were not observed centrally, supporting an absence of CNS penetrance, in line with observed reduction in CNS-associated Ex4 side effects. Cy5-B12-Ex4 colocalizes with insulin in the pancreas, suggesting direct pancreatic action as a potential mechanism underlying the hypoglycaemic effects of B12-Ex4. CONCLUSION: These novel findings highlight the potential clinical utility of B12-Ex4 conjugates as possible future T2DM therapeutics with reduced incidence of adverse effects.
29567019	Bevacizumab	Hypertension	0	0	0	0		[Systemic safety following intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF].	The goal of this manuscript is to assess data suggesting that intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs) could result in systemic adverse events (AEs). The class-specific systemic AEs should be similar to those encountered in cancer trials. The most frequent AE observed in oncology, hypertension and proteinuria, should thus be the most common expected in ophthalmology, but their severity should be lower because of the much lower doses of anti-VEGFs administered intravitreally. Such AEs have not been frequently reported in ophthalmology trials. In addition, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data describing systemic diffusion of anti-VEGFs should be interpreted with caution because of significant inconsistencies reported. Thus, safety data reported in ophthalmology trials and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data provide robust evidence that systemic events after intravitreal injection are very unlikely. Additional studies are needed to explore this issue further, as much remains to be understood about local and systemic side effects of anti-VEGFs.

The goal of this manuscript is to assess data suggesting that intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs) could result in systemic adverse events (AEs). The class-specific systemic AEs should be similar to those encountered in cancer trials. The most frequent AE observed in oncology, hypertension and proteinuria, should thus be the most common expected in ophthalmology, but their severity should be lower because of the much lower doses of anti-VEGFs administered intravitreally. Such AEs have not been frequently reported in ophthalmology trials. In addition, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data describing systemic diffusion of anti-VEGFs should be interpreted with caution because of significant inconsistencies reported. Thus, safety data reported in ophthalmology trials and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data provide robust evidence that systemic events after intravitreal injection are very unlikely. Additional studies are needed to explore this issue further, as much remains to be understood about local and systemic side effects of anti-VEGFs.

30447669	Propofol	Cognitive Dysfunction	1	0	0	0		Postoperative cognitive dysfunction after sevoflurane or propofol general anaesthesia in combination with spinal anaesthesia for hip arthroplasty.	It is unknown if the type of general anaesthetic used for maintenance of anaesthesia affects the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of POCD in patients administered either sevoflurane or propofol for maintenance of anaesthesia during total hip replacement surgery. Following administration of a spinal anaesthetic, patients received either sevoflurane (n=121) or propofol (n=171) at the discretion of the anaesthetist for maintenance of general anaesthesia to maintain the processed electroencephalogram (bispectral index, BIS) under 60. POCD was assessed postoperatively at day 7, three months, and 12 months using a neurocognitive test battery. There was no statistically significant difference between the incidence of POCD at any timepoint with sevoflurane compared to propofol. The mean BIS was significantly lower in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group (mean BIS 44.3 [standard deviation, SD 7.5] in the sevoflurane group versus 53.7 [SD 8.1] in the propofol group, P=0.0001). However, there was no statistically significant association between intraoperative BIS level and the incidence of POCD at any timepoint. Our results suggest that the incidence of POCD is not strongly influenced by the type of anaesthesia used in elderly patients.

28762178	Isotretinoin	Depression	0	0	0	0		The influence of duloxetine on detrusor overactivity in rats with depression induced by 13-cis-retinoic acid.	INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of duloxetine in an animal model of detrusor overactivity induced by depression. METHODS: After 6 weeks of 13-cis-retinoic acid administration at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day, rats were given duloxetine at a dose of 1 mg/kg. This was followed by conscious cystometry, a forced swim test, and locomotor activity measurement. The levels of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the hypothalamus, amygdala and plasma were also determined. RESULTS: Duloxetine treatment led to a reduction in detrusor overactivity symptoms induced by the retinoid. Decreases were observed in cystometric parameters including the detrusor overactivity index, and the amplitude and frequency of nonvoiding contractions, while increases were seen in bladder compliance and the volume threshold to elicit nonvoiding contractions. No statistically significant differences were found in basal pressure, threshold pressure, micturition voiding pressure, postvoid residual , volume threshold, voiding efficiency, intercontraction interval, bladder contraction duration or relaxation time. Duloxetine also reduced the immobility time to that observed in control animals, while it did not affect locomotor activity. Its effects also included lowering of the CRF levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala and plasma, which increased following the prior administration of the retinoid. The plasma level of 13-cis-retinoic acid in rats corresponded to the levels found in humans. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing the efficacy of duloxetine in an animal model of detrusor overactivity induced by depression. Further studies in patients with detrusor overactivity and coexisting depression are warranted to confirm these experimental results.

We report on a 52-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed methotrexate associated lymphoproliferative disorders (MTX-LPD) in the central nervous system (CNS) in the course of immunosuppressive therapy for RA. The patient was admitted because of monoplegia in her left hand. She had been receiving methotrexate (MTX) for her RA for several years and etanercept had also been introduced because of a worsening of the arthritis six months before admission. Brain MRI revealed multiple lesions with enhancement scattered throughout both hemispheres. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed abnormal accumulation suggesting malignancy in the right frontal lobe where abnormal enhancement was observed on the MRI. A brain biopsy was performed at the identified site and it confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We therefore diagnosed her as MTX-LPD. According to previous reports, most MTX-LPD cases tend to show regression after the cessation of MTX. However, our case showed no regression and even needed chemotherapy. The patient had a poorer prognosis than previous cases and died 17 months after the onset. Although it is an uncommon complication, particularly in the CNS, MTX-LPD should be considered as a critical differential diagnosis if a patient receiving MTX develops central nervous system lesions. Immediate medical intervention including brain biopsy is required.

29558860	Ketamine	Hypoxia	0	0	0	0		Pregnant sheep develop hypoxaemia during short-term anaesthesia for caesarean delivery.	Short-term anaesthesia of the pregnant ewe may be required for caesarean delivery of a preterm foetus within a research protocol. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the acid-base and haematological status of the ewe and foetus at the time of surgical delivery by collecting maternal and foetal arterial blood samples. Fifteen date-mated singleton-pregnant merino cross ewes at 122.0 (+/-0.5) days of gestation were anaesthetised with a combination of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (10 mg/kg) by intravenous injection. A subarachnoid injection of lidocaine (60 mg) was given to desensitise the caudal abdomen. Supplemental oxygen was not provided, and an endotracheal tube was not placed in the ewe's trachea. The development of maternal respiratory acidosis (hypercapnia) and hypoxaemia was anticipated. Samples of arterial blood for blood gas analyses were collected simultaneously from the radial artery of the ewe and the umbilical artery of the foetus immediately after delivery. The results from the maternal blood samples were within the normal range for pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO(2)), base excess, glucose, lactate, haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration. The maternal partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO(2)) revealed hypoxaemia: 45.2 (41.1-53.4) mmHg. Foetal arterial blood gas analysis revealed hypoxaemia (15.0 +/- 3.1 mmHg) and hypoglycaemia (0.1 (0.1-1.1) mmol/L). The benefit of providing supplemental oxygen and/or placing an endotracheal tube must be carefully weighed against the benefit of saving time when prompt delivery of the foetus is planned. In this study the pregnant ewe developed severe hypoxaemia, and this abnormality may have contributed to a low foetal PaO(2).

29149272	Acetaminophen	Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects	1	1	0	0	0.0	Use of paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin in pregnancy and risk of cerebral palsy in the child.	BACKGROUND: It has been debated whether mild analgesics, mainly paracetamol, adversely affect aspects of neurodevelopment. We examined whether mother's use of paracetamol, aspirin or ibuprofen in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of cerebral palsy (CP) in the child. METHOD: We included 185 617 mother-child pairs from the Danish National Birth Cohort and the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. We created harmonized definitions of analgesic use in pregnancy, as well as indications for analgesic use and other potential confounders. Children with CP were identified in nationwide registers. We estimated the average causal effect of analgesics on risk of CP using marginal structural models with stabilized inverse probability weights. RESULTS: Paracetamol use was reported in 49% of all pregnancies, aspirin in 3% and ibuprofen in 4%. Prenatal exposure to paracetamol ever in pregnancy was associated with increased risk of overall CP [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-1.7] and unilateral spastic CP (aOR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.2). The association appeared to be driven by an increased risk of unilateral spastic CP in children exposed in second trimester (aOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.5). Children ever prenatally exposed to aspirin in pregnancy had an elevated risk of bilateral spastic CP (aOR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.3) compared with unexposed. CONCLUSION: We observed an increased risk of spastic CP in children prenatally exposed to paracetamol and aspirin. Although we controlled for several important indications for analgesic use, we cannot exclude the possibility of confounding by underlying diseases.

BACKGROUND: Clinical variables including hypertension could be linked with major bleeding events and death beyond vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or direct oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) treatment strategy. METHODS: Subgroup analysis of major bleeding (primary endpoint) associated with clinical variables, site of bleeding, ongoing antithrombotics, reversal treatment or blood transfusion, outcomes (secondary endpoints) was performed in patients with bleeding events submitted to hard 5:1 propensity-score matching for hypertension. RESULTS: Enrolled patients were 2,792 (mean age, 65.6 +/- 19.9 years) during 2-year survey including 166,000 visits, of 200,000 inhabitants catchment area; 8,239 patients received warfarin and 3,797 DOACs. Hypertension account for 1,077 (39%) patients; major bleeding for 474 (17%); death for 29 (1%), and 72 (3%) on 1-month and 1-year, respectively. Hypertension, age, glucose, cancer, ischemic vascular disease, and CHA2D2VASc score were more likely to link with major bleeding. On multivariate analysis, only age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; P < 0.001), CHA2DS2VASc score >/= 2 (OR, 2.14; P = 0.001), and glucose (OR, 1.01; P = 0.005) were predictors of major bleeding. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated patients with hypertension as compared with patients without showed 60% versus 20% death on 1-month (P < 0.001). Warfarin compared with DOACs was more likely to present with major bleeding (0.7% versus 0.2%; OR, 2.8; P = 0.005). Receiver operator characteristics analysis showed high value (0.61) of age and glucose over creatinine and systolic arterial pressure (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Four in 10 patients with major bleeding showed hypertension; of these 8 in 10 will die within 1 month. Warfarin compared with DOACs was more likely to present with major bleeding.

Hypertension account for 1,077 (39%) patients; major bleeding for 474 (17%); death for 29 (1%), and 72 (3%) on 1-month and 1-year, respectively. Hypertension, age, glucose, cancer, ischemic vascular disease, and CHA2D2VASc score were more likely to link with major bleeding. On multivariate analysis, only age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; P < 0.001), CHA2DS2VASc score >/= 2 (OR, 2.14; P = 0.001), and glucose (OR, 1.01; P = 0.005) were predictors of major bleeding. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated patients with hypertension as compared with patients without showed 60% versus 20% death on 1-month (P < 0.001). Warfarin compared with DOACs was more likely to present with major bleeding (0.7% versus 0.2%; OR, 2.8; P = 0.005). Receiver operator characteristics analysis showed high value (0.61) of age and glucose over creatinine and systolic arterial pressure (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Four in 10 patients with major bleeding showed hypertension; of these 8 in 10 will die within 1 month. Warfarin compared with DOACs was more likely to present with major bleeding.

BACKGROUND: Bullous disorders associated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy are increasingly reported and may pose distinct therapeutic challenges. Their frequency and impact on cancer therapy are not well established. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and histopathologic findings, frequency, and impact on cancer therapy of bullous eruptions due to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients evaluated by the oncodermatology clinic and consultative service of Yale New Haven Hospital from 2016 to 2018. RESULTS: We identified 9 of 853 patients who developed bullous eruptions ( approximately 1%) that were treated with an-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy at our institution during the study period: 7 presented with bullous pemphigoid, 1 presented with bullous lichenoid dermatitis, and 1 presented with linear IgA bullous dermatosis in the context of vancomycin therapy. In all, 8 patients required systemic steroids, 5 required maintenance therapy, and 8 required interruption of immunotherapy. All 9 patients had an initial positive tumor response or stable disease, but 4 went on to develop disease progression. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study from a single tertiary care center. CONCLUSIONS: Bullous disorders developed in approximately 1% of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy at our institution and frequently resulted in interruption of immune therapy and management with systemic corticosteroids and occasionally steroid-sparing agents.
30021735	Prednisone	Cryptococcosis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Cryptococcus neoformans empyema in a patient receiving ibrutinib for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and a review of the literature.	We report a case of Cryptococcus neoformans pulmonary infection complicated by empyema in a 79-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP and ibrutinib. A literature review identified 25 cases of cryptococcal pleural disease published since 1980. Most cases were caused by the C. neoformans species in immunocompromised hosts with an exudative pleural effusion and lymphocyte-predominant infiltrate. The cryptococcal antigen test was often positive when pleural fluid and serum were tested. The outcome was favourable in most cases with antifungal therapy and either thoracocentesis or surgical resection. We also identified 40 cases of opportunistic infections, most commonly aspergillosis, cryptococcosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, in patients treated with ibrutinib. In vitro studies indicate Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibition impairs phagocyte function and offer a mechanism for the apparent association between ibrutinib and invasive fungal infections.
30173288	Antilymphocyte Serum	Infections	1	1	0	0	0.0	Immunosuppressive therapy for aplastic anemia: a single-center experience from western India.	Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclosporine A (CsA) is the first-line therapy for acquired aplastic anemia (AA) in those not suitable for bone marrow transplant. Horse ATG (hATG) is preferred for this purpose, but its use is often impeded by shortages and costs. Being a rare disease, there is limited data on this therapy. This study aimed to evaluate this therapy in a large cohort of AA patients from western India. We retrospectively analyzed AA patients who received an indigenous preparation of hATG along with CsA as first-line treatment, between 2012 and 2015, at our center and evaluated the response, survival, and occurrence of adverse events. The response was further assessed separately for adults and children. During the period, 91 AA patients (4 non-severe, 57 severe and 30 very severe) were treated with IST. At 2 years, 23.5% adults and 39.1% children showed complete response and an overall of 68.1% cases became transfusion independent. More than half of the patients developed febrile neutropenia while roughly one sixth of the patients developed gum hypertrophy and/or hypertension. Two patients had clonal evolution. Mortality rate was calculated to be 31%; most common causes of death were infection and intracranial hemorrhage. The results of the study substantiate the effectiveness of IST in AA, using an inexpensive indigenous preparation of hATG along with CsA.

The response was further assessed separately for adults and children. During the period, 91 AA patients (4 non-severe, 57 severe and 30 very severe) were treated with IST. At 2 years, 23.5% adults and 39.1% children showed complete response and an overall of 68.1% cases became transfusion independent. More than half of the patients developed febrile neutropenia while roughly one sixth of the patients developed gum hypertrophy and/or hypertension. Two patients had clonal evolution. Mortality rate was calculated to be 31%; most common causes of death were infection and intracranial hemorrhage. The results of the study substantiate the effectiveness of IST in AA, using an inexpensive indigenous preparation of hATG along with CsA.

29923433	Octreotide	Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency	1	1	0	0	0.0	Somatostatin analogue-induced pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in patients with neuroendocrine tumors: results of a prospective observational study.	BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (Wd-NETs) are commonly treated with somatostatin analogues (SSAs). Some patients may develop SSA-related side effects such as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI). METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, the frequency of SSA-induced PEI in 50 sequential patients with advanced Wd-NETs treated with SSAs was investigated. Toxicity was assessed monthly and faecal elastase-1 (FE1) and quality of life (QoL) were assessed 3-monthly. RESULTS: The median age was 65.8 years, 58% were male and the majority (92%) of patients had metastatic disease; patients received 4-weekly long acting octreotide (60%) or lanreotide (40%). Twelve patients (24%) developed SSA-related PEI after a median of 2.9 months from SSA initiation; FE1 was a reliable screening tool for PEI, especially in symptomatic (abdominal bloating, flatulence and/or diarrhea) patients (risk ratio 8.25 (95% confidence interval 1.15-59.01)). Most of these patients (11/12; 92%) required PERT. Other SSA-related adverse events (any grade) included flatulence (50%), abdominal pain (32%), diarrhoea (30%) and fatigue (20%). Development of PEI did not significantly worsen overall QoL, however gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhoea were increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that PEI occurs at a higher rate than previously reported; clinicians need to diagnose and treat this SSA-related adverse-event which occurs in 1 in 4 patients with Wd-NETs treated with SSAs. Screening with FE1 in symtomatic patients is recommend.
30593135	Testosterone	Breast Neoplasms	1	1	1	1	1.0	Long-term hormonal therapy resulting in breast cancer in female-to-male transsexual: Case report.	RATIONALE: Testosterone is important for the development of secondary sexual characteristics in female-to-male transsexuals. On the contrary, it can increase the risk of breast cancer. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present a rare case of breast cancer in female-to-male transsexual patient after long-term hormonal therapy. DIAGNOSIS: Breast cancer in female-to-male transsexual patient. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent mastectomy and chemotherapy. OUTCOMES: The patient had local recurrence of the disease and he underwent re-excision, radiotherapy and the tamoxifen treatment. After this treatment, the patient is in the remission from the disease. LESSONS: Breast cancer in transsexuals appears to be rare. However, there is a potential risk that testosterone exposure can increase the risk of developing breast cancer by the stimulation of breast tissue. There is limited published literature on the risk of breast cancer in transsexual patients.
30003318	Heparin	Thrombocytopenia	0	1	0	0		Comparison of argatroban and fondaparinux for the management of patients with isolated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.	Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious complication of the administration of heparin and its derivatives. Non-heparin anticoagulants such as argatroban and fondaparinux are widely used in the management of HIT to compare the effectiveness of argatroban and fondaparinux in the resolution of thrombocytopenia and to compare clinical outcomes in patients with isolated HIT. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) on patients diagnosed with isolated HIT between 31 Jan, 2014 and 30 June, 2017. Demographics data, non-heparin anticoagulants, related laboratory results, and clinical outcomes were retrieved and analysed. The cohort comprised a total of 95 adult patients who received either argatroban (56 patients) or fondaparinux (39 patients) for isolated HIT. The median age and sex distribution were similar in both argatroban and fondaparinux groups. The mean (+ SD) time (in days) for the resolution of thrombocytopenia was 3.5 (+/- 1.8) for patients who received argatroban and 3.7 (+/- 1.7) for patients administered fondaparinux (p = 0.843). Thromboembolic events occurred in five patients (8.9%) administered argatroban and in three patients (7.7%) administered fondaparinux (p = 0.382). There was no significant difference in the rates of bleeding or death (p = 0.829); however, the small number of cases limits our ability to draw conclusions about these outcomes. In this retrospective study, fondaparinux and argatroban were similarly effective in resolving thrombocytopenia, preventing further thromboembolic events, and maintaining safety in patients with confirmed HIT. To confirm this observation, larger prospective studies are needed.

29429882	Bupivacaine	Urinary Retention	0	0	0	0		Mepivacaine Spinal Anesthesia Facilitates Rapid Recovery in Total Knee Arthroplasty Compared to Bupivacaine.	BACKGROUND: Mepivacaine as a spinal anesthetic for rapid recovery in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has not been assessed. The purpose of this study is to compare spinal mepivacaine vs bupivacaine for postoperative measures in patients undergoing primary TKA. METHODS: Retrospective review of a prospectively collected single-institution database was performed on 156 consecutive patients who underwent primary TKA. Fifty-three patients were administered mepivacaine and 103 patients were administered bupivacaine. Primary outcomes were urinary retention, length of stay, pain control, opioid consumption, and distance associated with physical therapy. Statistical analysis with univariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the effect of anesthetic with primary outcomes. RESULTS: Patients undergoing TKA with mepivacaine had a shorter length of stay (28.1 +/- 11.2 vs 33.6 +/- 14.4 hours, P = .002) and fewer episodes of straight catheterization (3.8% vs 16.5%, P = .021) compared to bupivacaine. Patients administered mepivacaine exhibited slightly higher VAS pain scores and morphine consumption in the postanesthesia care unit (1.3 +/- 1.9 vs 0.5 +/- 1.3, P = .002; 2.2 +/- 3.3 vs 0.8 +/- 2.1 equivalents/h, P = .002), but otherwise exhibited no difference in VAS scores or morphine consumption afterwards. There was no need to convert to general anesthesia or transient neurologic symptom complication in either group. CONCLUSION: Mepivacaine for spinal anesthesia with TKA had adequate duration to complete the surgery and facilitated a more rapid recovery with less urinary complications and a shorter length of stay. Patients administered mepivacaine did not display worse pain control or transient neurologic symptoms afterwards.
29427835	Phenytoin	Ataxia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Phenytoin-related ataxia in patients with epilepsy: clinical and radiological characteristics.	PURPOSE: Phenytoin is an effective anticonvulsant for focal epilepsy. Its use can be associated with long-term adverse effects including cerebellar ataxia. Whilst phenytoin is toxic to Purkinje cells in vitro; the clinical and radiological phenotype and mechanism of cerebellar degeneration in vivo remain unclear. We describe the prevalence, clinical and radiological characteristics of phenytoin-related ataxia. METHODS: Patients with epilepsy receiving treatment with phenytoin were recruited from the Epilepsy clinics at Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK. Neurological examination was performed on all patients after recruitment. Patients were categorised into those with and without ataxia. We determined the severity of ataxia clinically (SARA score) and the pattern of cerebellar involvement by neuroimaging (MRI volumetry and MR spectroscopy). RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were recruited. Median duration of epilepsy was 24 years, median duration of phenytoin treatment was 15 years and current median phenytoin daily dose was 325 mg. Fifty-five percent of patients complained of poor balance. Clinical evidence of ataxia was seen in 40% patients. Gait, stance and heel-shin slide were the predominant features of cerebellar dysfunction. MRI demonstrated structural, volumetric and functional deficits of the cerebellum. Only one patient with ataxia had phenytoin levels above the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar ataxia is present in 40% of patients with epilepsy and chronic exposure to phenytoin. Patients on long-term phenytoin have reduced cerebellar volume even if they have no clinical evidence of ataxia. Evidence of structural deficits on imaging suggests a predilection for vermian involvement.

29425799	Vancomycin	Retinal Artery Occlusion	1	1	0	0	0.0	Vancomycin-Associated Hemorrhagic Occlusive Retinal Vasculitis: A Clinical-Pathophysiological Analysis.	PURPOSE: To derive novel insights into the pathophysiology of vancomycin-related hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculopathy (HORV) through a careful clinicopathologic correlation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and pathologic course of 2 consecutive patients who developed HORV. The clinical history, multimodal imaging, ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), and intraoperative and histologic findings are reported. RESULTS: Both patients presented with decreased vision and eye pain within 1 week following otherwise uncomplicated cataract extraction and were diagnosed with HORV after endophthalmitis was ruled out. Both patients presented with significant ocular discomfort that progressively worsened, and both experienced a dismal visual outcome despite early aggressive medical and surgical therapy. One patient requested enucleation for a blind and painful eye. Upon histologic examination of this eye, the iris and ciliary body appeared to be infarcted with separation of the iris and ciliary epithelia from their adjacent stromal components. These findings were corroborated by UBM of the second patient. Histologic examination of the posterior segment demonstrated severe hemorrhagic necrosis of the neurosensory retina and an occlusive nonarteritic vasculopathy of the retina and choroid. The choroid was thickened by prominent nongranulomatous chronic inflammation accompanied by a glomeruloid proliferation of small vessels. The inflammatory infiltrate was almost exclusively confined to the choroid and consisted of predominantly T cells. There was conspicuous absence of inflammatory cells in the retina and no histologic evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. CONCLUSIONS: HORV is a rare condition that can lead to profound vision loss. Significant ocular pain can be a presenting sign of HORV in cases with severe iris and ciliary body ischemia. Although it has been suggested that HORV is a form of leukocytoclastic retinal vasculitis, the histologic findings herein indicate that the pathophysiology is more complex. It is grounded in a necrotizing retinal vasculopathy in the absence of retinal vasculitis, chronic nongranulomatous choroiditis, and an unusual glomeruloid proliferation of endothelial cells in the choroid and elsewhere in the eye.

30673037	Sorbitol	Ulcer	1	1	0	1	1.0	Rectal ulcer due to Kayexalate deposition - an unusual case.	Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PSP) or Kayexalate is a cation-exchange resin, widely used in the management of hyperkalaemia due to renal disease. A rare, yet potentially dangerous, adverse event related to sodium polystyrene sulfonate use is intestinal mucosal injury, especially in the colon. The injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa can range from mild and superficial to wall necrosis and bowel perforation. The mechanism that leads to mucosal damage remains unclear. However, it is believed that sorbitol, commonly given to counteract PSP's tendency to cause constipation, may play an important role in the development of gastrointestinal injury. Other potential risk factors are uraemia or end-stage renal disease, hemodynamic instability, solid organ transplantation, postoperative status and concomitant opioid administration. The authors present a case of diarrhoea and haematochezia after the administration of PSP without sorbitol, in a patient with hyperkalaemia due to acute kidney injury, in the absence of other risk factors. A colonoscopy was performed and revealed a rectal ulcer which histological findings were suggestive of mucosal injury due to Kayexalate deposition. This case supports the concept that this widely used drug can itself, without sorbitol, cause injury to the gastrointestinal wall. Even though this is a rare adverse effect, the widespread use of this medication may put a large population at risk.

After 2 courses of treatment, computed tomography revealed that his abdominal aortic artery was almost occluded by a thrombus; however, he had no ischemic symptoms. Heparin infusion and warfarin reduced the size of the arterial thrombus and the patient was subsequently treated with chemotherapy without bevacizumab. No thrombotic events occurred during the subsequent treatment. We later noticed a small organized abdominal arterial clot and calcification on a computed tomography scan taken before bevacizumab treatment. Atherosclerotic changes should be evaluated before the administration of bevacizumab.

29331603	Risperidone	Metabolic Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Metabolic risk factors in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: The effect of comedication with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antipsychotics.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this observational study was to investigate the relationship between metabolic factors and use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) combined with olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone. METHODS: Data from the Norwegian Thematically Organized Psychosis study, a cross-sectional study on 1301 patients with schizophrenia (n=868) or bipolar disorder (n=433), were analyzed. As exposure variables in the linear regression model were included the dose or serum concentration of SSRIs (n=280) and of olanzapine (n=398), quetiapine (n=234) or risperidone (n=128). The main outcome variables were levels of total cholesterol, low and high density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. RESULTS: One defined daily dose (DDD) per day of an SSRI in addition to olanzapine was associated with an increase in total cholesterol of 0.16 (CI 0.01 to 0.32) mmol/L (P=0.042) and an increase in LDL-cholesterol of 0.17 (CI 0.02 to 0.31) mmol/L (P=0.022). An SSRI serum concentration in the middle of the reference interval in addition to quetiapine was associated with an increase in total cholesterol of 0.39 (CI 0.10 to 0.68) mmol/L (P=0.011) and an increase in LDL-cholesterol of 0.29 (0.02 to 0.56) mmol/L (P=0.037). There were no such effects when combined with risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate only minor deteriorations of metabolic variables associated with treatment with an SSRI in addition to olanzapine and quetiapine, and none when combined with risperidone. These results suggest that SSRIs can be used in combination with antipsychotics, and that the possible increase in cardiovascular risk is negligible.

28205213	Fentanyl	Hypertension	0	0	0	0		Haemodynamic changes to a midazolam-fentanyl-rocuronium protocol for pre-hospital anaesthesia following return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest.	Following the return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, neurological dysfunction, airway or ventilatory compromise can impede transport to early percutaneous coronary intervention, necessitating pre-hospital or emergency department anaesthesia to facilitate this procedure. There are no published reports of the ideal induction agents in these patients. We sought to describe haemodynamic changes associated with induction of anaesthesia using a midazolam (0.1 mg.kg(-1) ), fentanyl (2 mug.kg(-1) ) and rocuronium (1 mg.kg(-1) ) regimen developed using expert opinion, and adherence to the protocol by our pre-hospital teams. We performed a retrospective review of haemodynamic data recorded during induction of anaesthesia in patients following return of spontaneous circulation, over a 30-month period. We analysed the changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate using a repeated-measures design, as well as the rate of new hypotension or hypertension. Sixty-four patients had four consecutive measurements for analysis (one pre-induction and three post-induction). Systolic blood pressure at all three post-induction measurements was significantly lower than the pre-induction value. Heart rate did not differ between any time-points. New episodes of hypotension (systolic pressure < 90 mmHg) occurred in four (6%) patients at the first measurement post-induction (95%CI 2-15%) and 10 (16%) at the third measurement (95%CI 8-27%). Three patients (5%; 95%CI 1-13%) had a hypertensive response. The median (IQR[range]) dose of midazolam given at induction was 0.04 (0.03-0.05 [0.01 to 0.10]) mg.kg(-1) . Adherence to recommended fentanyl and rocuronium doses was high. Overall, systolic blood pressure was reduced following induction of anaesthesia, and systolic pressures < 90 mmHg occurred more often at measurements made later (up to 9 min) after induction. Changes in heart rate, and new hypertension were uncommon.

Following the return of spontaneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, neurological dysfunction, airway or ventilatory compromise can impede transport to early percutaneous coronary intervention, necessitating pre-hospital or emergency department anaesthesia to facilitate this procedure. There are no published reports of the ideal induction agents in these patients. We sought to describe haemodynamic changes associated with induction of anaesthesia using a midazolam (0.1 mg.kg(-1) ), fentanyl (2 mug.kg(-1) ) and rocuronium (1 mg.kg(-1) ) regimen developed using expert opinion, and adherence to the protocol by our pre-hospital teams. We performed a retrospective review of haemodynamic data recorded during induction of anaesthesia in patients following return of spontaneous circulation, over a 30-month period. We analysed the changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate using a repeated-measures design, as well as the rate of new hypotension or hypertension. Sixty-four patients had four consecutive measurements for analysis (one pre-induction and three post-induction). Systolic blood pressure at all three post-induction measurements was significantly lower than the pre-induction value. Heart rate did not differ between any time-points. New episodes of hypotension (systolic pressure < 90 mmHg) occurred in four (6%) patients at the first measurement post-induction (95%CI 2-15%) and 10 (16%) at the third measurement (95%CI 8-27%). Three patients (5%; 95%CI 1-13%) had a hypertensive response. The median (IQR[range]) dose of midazolam given at induction was 0.04 (0.03-0.05 [0.01 to 0.10]) mg.kg(-1) . Adherence to recommended fentanyl and rocuronium doses was high. Overall, systolic blood pressure was reduced following induction of anaesthesia, and systolic pressures < 90 mmHg occurred more often at measurements made later (up to 9 min) after induction. Changes in heart rate, and new hypertension were uncommon.
29169823	Dexamethasone	Diabetes Complications	0	0	0	0		Effect of intra-operative single dose of dexamethasone for control of post-operative nausea and vomiting on the control of glucose levels in diabetic patients.	BACKGROUND: Dexamethasone adds a unique challenge to glycemic control, and it may complicate patient care if there is an association between intra-operative dexamethasone and blood glucose levels. METHODS: We analyzed 396 diabetic patients who underwent general anesthesia for various surgical procedures and were hospitalized post-operatively for at least 24 h between January 2015 and June 2016. Patients were classified into two groups-those who received dexamethasone intra-operatively and those who did not. The groups were analyzed for blood glucose changes during and following their procedure. RESULTS: A total of 396 diabetic patients (152 (38.8%) dexamethasone group; 244 (62.2%) control) were included. The dexamethasone group had significantly lower preoperative blood glucose (135.5 mmol/L) compared to the control group (144.4 mmol/L) (p = 0.04) and significantly lower proportion of patients who had received insulin during surgery (14.9%) compared to the control group (23.4%) (p = 0.04). Overall, glucose levels declined from pre-op to post-op day 1 by 9.6 (62.9) (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Diabetic patients receiving dexamethasone for control of post-operative nausea during surgery are at greater risk for increasing blood glucose levels and difficult glycemic control during and after surgery compared to patients receiving other medications to control post-operative nausea.

29685923	Caffeine	Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects	1	1	0	0	0.0	Maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and childhood growth and overweight: results from a large Norwegian prospective observational cohort study.	OBJECTIVES: To study the association between maternal caffeine intake during pregnancy and the child's weight gain and overweight risk up to 8 years. DESIGN: Prospective nationwide pregnancy cohort. SETTING: The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 50 943 mothers recruited from 2002 to 2008 and their children, after singleton pregnancies, with information about average caffeine intake assessed at mid-pregnancy. OUTCOME MEASURE: Child's body size information at 11 age points from 6 weeks to 8 years. We defined excess growth in infancy as a WHO weight gain z-score of >0.67 from birth to age 1 year, and overweight according to the International Obesity Task Force. We used a growth model to assess individual growth trajectories. RESULTS: Compared with pregnant women with low caffeine intake (<50 mg/day, 46%), women with average (50-199 mg/day, 44%), high (>/=200-299 mg/day, 7%) and very high (>/=300 mg/day, 3%) caffeine intakes had an increased risk of their child experiencing excess growth in infancy, after adjustment for confounders (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.22, OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.45, OR=1.66, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.93, respectively). In utero exposure to any caffeine was associated with higher risk of overweight at age 3 years and 5 years, while the association persisted at 8 years, only for very high exposures. Any caffeine intake was associated with increased body mass index from infancy to childhood. Children prenatally exposed to caffeine intake >200 mg/day had consistently higher weight. Very high caffeine exposures were associated with higher weight gain velocity from infancy to age 8 years. CONCLUSION: Any caffeine consumption during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of excess infant growth and of childhood overweight, mainly at preschool ages. Maternal caffeine intake may modify the overall weight growth trajectory of the child from birth to 8 years. This study adds supporting evidence for the current advice to reduce caffeine intake during pregnancy.

We herein report a rare case of methotrexate (MTX)-associated intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) in a man with rheumatoid arthritis. Two episodes of a fever of unknown origin accompanied by elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and the soluble interleukin-2 receptor occurred within a year, so the patient was suspected of having an MTX-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. His clinical symptoms resolved after the cessation of MTX. However, after treatment with iguratimod, another disease-modified anti-rheumatic drug, markedly similar symptoms recurred, and random skin biopsies resulted in a diagnosis of IVLBCL. The patient received a rituximab-containing chemotherapy and achieved complete remission.

28635316	Microbial Collagenase	Blister	1	1	0	1	1.0	Complications Following Collagenase Treatment for Dupuytren Contracture.	BACKGROUND: Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection and manipulation is a relatively new method for treating Dupuytren contracture that is growing in popularity. Although side effects such as swelling and ecchymosis are common, they are typically mild and self-limited. Major complications are rare but have included flexor tendon rupture and complex regional pain syndrome. METHODS: This study describes a case report of 2 patients seen at our institution. RESULTS: Here, we report 2 patients seen at our institution each with different, yet serious complications after CCH injection and manipulation. One patient had extensive skin loss and chose amputation over reconstruction. The other patient had loss of perfusion and required finger amputation. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is unclear how directly the administration of CCH is connected to the observed complications, physicians should recognize the potential for serious rare complications in any treatment of Dupuytren contracture.
29866170	Fluorouracil	Nausea	1	0	0	0		Attenuated FOLFIRINOX in the salvage treatment of gemcitabine-refractory advanced pancreatic cancer: a phase II study.	BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) chemotherapy drastically improves survival of advanced pancreatic cancer patients. However, the efficacy of FOLFIRINOX as a second-line treatment after gemcitabine failure has not been tested prospectively. We investigated the feasibility and safety of attenuated FOLFIRINOX in patients with gemcitabine-refractory advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A multicenter phase II prospective open-label, single-arm study was conducted at 14 hospitals. Patients with histologically proven invasive ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a measurable or evaluable lesion, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, adequate organ function, and aged 19 years or older were eligible. Attenuated FOLFIRINOX consisted of oxaliplatin 65 mg/m(2), irinotecan 135 mg/m(2), and leucovorin 400 mg/m(2) injected intravenously on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 2000 mg/m(2) continuously infused intravenously over 46 h on days 1-2, repeated every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival from the initiation of FOLFIRINOX. Secondary endpoints were the objective response rate, disease control rate, overall survival, safety, and tolerability. We estimated overall survival and progression-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: We enrolled 39 patients from 14 institutions. The objective response rate was 10.3%, while the disease control rate was 64.1%. The 6-month and 1-year overall survival rates were 59.0% and 15.4%, respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-6.0 months) and 8.5 months (95% CI 5.6-11.4 months), respectively. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were neutropenia (41.0%), nausea (10.3%), anorexia (10.3%), anemia (7.7%), mucositis (7.7%), pneumonia/pleural effusion (5.1%), and fatigue (5.1%). One treatment-related death attributable to septic shock occurred. CONCLUSION: Attenuated FOLFIRINOX may be promising as a second-line therapy for gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic cancer.

30247099	Emtricitabine, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Drug Combination	Kidney Diseases	0	0	0	0		Health Care Costs in a Cohort of HIV-Infected U.S. Veterans Receiving Regimens Containing Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate/Emtricitabine.	BACKGROUND: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a key component in many human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment regimens, is associated with increased renal and bone toxicities. The contributions of such toxicities to treatment costs, as well as the relative differences in treatment costs for various TDF/emtricitabine (FTC) regimens, remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To estimate and compare mean overall and renal- and bone-specific costs, including total, inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy costs in patients treated with TDF/FTC+efavirenz (EFV) compared with several non-EFV-containing TDF/FTC regimens. METHODS: We conducted a national cohort study of treatment-naive HIV-infected U.S. veterans who initiated treatment from 2003 to 2015 with TDF/FTC in combination with EFV, elvitegravir/cobicistat, rilpivirine, or ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir, or lopinavir). Outcomes of interest were quarterly total, inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy costs using data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic medical record and Managerial Cost Accounting System (an activity-based accounting system that allocates VHA expenditures to patient encounters). We controlled for measured confounders using inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weights and assessed differences using standardized mean differences (SMDs). For comparisons where SMDs exceeded 0.1 after IPT weighting, we used the more conservative matching weights in sensitivity analyses. For hypothesis testing, we compared IPT-adjusted differences in quarterly costs between treatment groups using Mann-Whitney U-tests and generalized estimating equation (GEE) regression models. RESULTS: Of 33,048 HIV-positive veterans, 7,222 met eligibility criteria, including 4,172 TDF/FTC + EFV recipients; mean (SD) age of the cohort was 50.0 (10.0) years; 96.7% were male; 60.1% were black; and 30.1% were white. Quarterly periods of exposure to EFV-containing regimens were 22,499 and of exposure to non-EFV-containing regimens were 11,633. After IPT weighting, absolute SMDs were < 0.1 except for a few covariates in the rilpivirine comparison. The per-patient adjusted mean total quarterly costs were $7,145 for EFV versus $8,726 for non-EFV (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U-test) and the per-patient adjusted mean difference in total quarterly costs was $1,419 lower for EFV versus all non-EFV combined (P < 0.001; GEE model). Corresponding values for outpatient costs ($2,656 vs. $2,942; P < 0.001; difference, -$254; P = 0.001), inpatient costs ($2,009 vs. $2,614; P < 0.001), radiology costs ($213 vs. $276; P < 0.001), and pharmacy costs ($2,480 vs. $3,170; P < 0.001; difference, -$600; P < 0.001) were all lower for EFV versus all non-EFV combined. Findings based on matching weights were qualitatively similar. Contributions of renal and bone costs to the total costs of treatment were very small, ranging between $52 and $94 per patient per quarter for renal outcomes and between $6 and $114 for bone outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among 7,222 HIV-treated veterans over an average follow-up of 1.2 years per patient, those patients receiving TDF/FTC + EFV had lower overall health care costs compared with those receiving non-EFV regimens.

29800643	Arsenic	Kidney Diseases	0	1	0	0		Evaluation of kidney injury biomarkers in an adult Mexican population environmentally exposed to fluoride and low arsenic levels.	Fluoride (F) is a toxicant widely distributed in the environment. Experimental studies have shown kidney toxicity from F exposure. However, co-exposure to arsenic (As) has not been considered, and epidemiological information remains limited. We evaluated the association between F exposure and urinary kidney injury biomarkers and assessed As co-exposure interactions. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 239 adults (18-77 years old) from three communities in Chihuahua, Mexico. Exposure to F was assessed in urine and drinking water, and As in urine samples. We evaluated the urinary concentrations of albumin (ALB), cystatin-C (Cys-C), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), clusterin (CLU), osteopontin (OPN), and trefoil factor 3 (TFF-3). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using serum creatinine (Creat) levels. We observed a positive correlation between water and urine F concentrations (rho = 0.7419, p < 0.0001), with median values of 1.5 mg/L and 2 mug/mL, respectively, suggesting that drinking water was the main source of F exposure. The geometric mean of urinary As was 18.55 ng/mL, approximately 39% of the urine samples had As concentrations above the human biomonitoring value (15 ng/mL). Multiple linear regression models demonstrated a positive association between urinary F and ALB (beta = 0.56, p < 0.001), Cys-C (beta = 0.022, p = 0.001), KIM-1 (beta = 0.048, p = 0.008), OPN (beta = 0.38, p = 0.041), and eGFR (beta = 0.49, p = 0.03); however, CLU (beta = 0.07, p = 0.100) and TFF-3 (beta = 1.14, p = 0.115) did not show significant associations. No interaction with As exposure was observed. In conclusion, F exposure was related to the urinary excretion of early kidney injury biomarkers, supporting the hypothesis of the nephrotoxic role of F exposure.

29749462	Lithium	Seizures	0	0	0	0		Immunotherapy by targeting of VGKC complex for seizure control and prevention of cognitive impairment in a mouse model of epilepsy.	Epilepsy is a type of refractory neurologic disorder mental disease, which is associated with cognitive impairments and memory dysfunction. However, the potential mechanisms of epilepsy are not well understood. Previous evidence has identi fi ed the voltage gated potassium channel complex (VGKC) as a target in various cohorts of patients with epilepsy. In the present study, the efficacy of an antibody against VGKC (anti‑VGKC) for the treatment of epilepsy in mice was investigated. A mouse model of lithium‑pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy was established and anti‑VGKC treatment was administered for 30 days. Memory impairment, anxiety, visual attention, inhibitory control and neuronal loss were measured in the mouse model of lithium‑pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy. The results revealed that epileptic mice treated with anti‑VGKC were able to learn the task and presented attention impairment, even a tendency toward impulsivity and compulsivity. It was also exhibited that anti‑VGKC treatment decreased neuronal loss in structures classically associated with attentional performance in hippocampus. Mice who received Anti‑VGKC treatment had inhibited motor seizures and hippocampal damage as compared with control mice. In conclusion, these results indicated that anti‑VGKC treatment may present benefits for improvements of the condition of motor attention impairment and cognitive competence, which suggests that VGKC may be a potential target for the treatment of epilepsy.
29749462	Pilocarpine	Seizures	0	0	0	0		Immunotherapy by targeting of VGKC complex for seizure control and prevention of cognitive impairment in a mouse model of epilepsy.	Epilepsy is a type of refractory neurologic disorder mental disease, which is associated with cognitive impairments and memory dysfunction. However, the potential mechanisms of epilepsy are not well understood. Previous evidence has identi fi ed the voltage gated potassium channel complex (VGKC) as a target in various cohorts of patients with epilepsy. In the present study, the efficacy of an antibody against VGKC (anti‑VGKC) for the treatment of epilepsy in mice was investigated. A mouse model of lithium‑pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy was established and anti‑VGKC treatment was administered for 30 days. Memory impairment, anxiety, visual attention, inhibitory control and neuronal loss were measured in the mouse model of lithium‑pilocarpine temporal lobe epilepsy. The results revealed that epileptic mice treated with anti‑VGKC were able to learn the task and presented attention impairment, even a tendency toward impulsivity and compulsivity. It was also exhibited that anti‑VGKC treatment decreased neuronal loss in structures classically associated with attentional performance in hippocampus. Mice who received Anti‑VGKC treatment had inhibited motor seizures and hippocampal damage as compared with control mice. In conclusion, these results indicated that anti‑VGKC treatment may present benefits for improvements of the condition of motor attention impairment and cognitive competence, which suggests that VGKC may be a potential target for the treatment of epilepsy.
28971230	Lisuride	Cognition Disorders	1	0	0	0		Effects of 2-bromoterguride, a dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonist, on cognitive dysfunction and social aversion in rats.	RATIONALE: 2-Bromoterguride, a dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonist with antagonist properties at serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors, meets the prerequisites of a putative atypical antipsychotic drug (APD). We recently showed that 2-bromoterguride is effective in tests of positive symptoms of schizophrenia in rats without inducing extrapyramidal side effects or metabolic changes. OBJECTIVE: In continuation of our recent work, we now investigated the effect of 2-bromoterguride on apomorphine and phencyclidine (PCP)-induced disruptions of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, a measure of sensory gating. In addition, we used subchronic PCP treatment to produce cognitive deficits and social aversion, and assessed the effect of 2-bromoterguride on the performance in the novel object recognition (NOR) task (model for studying cognitive deficit symptoms of schizophrenia) and the social interaction test (model for studying negative symptoms of schizophrenia). Finally, we extended the side effect profile of 2-bromoterguride by measuring the prolactin response to systemic administration of the drug in rats. RESULTS: Treatment with 2-bromoterguride (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) reversed PPI deficits induced by apomorphine and PCP, respectively. Subchronic PCP induced impairments in object memory and social interaction behavior which were ameliorated by 2-bromoterguride but not by clozapine and aripiprazole, respectively. Prolactin concentration in blood serum was not elevated at 1, 2, or 4 h post-2-bromoterguride treatment, which further supports the safe and effective use of this drug. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support 2-bromoterguride as a promising APD candidate due to its beneficial effect on cognitive impairments and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

Several previously published trials comparing Zotarolimus Eluting Stents (ZES) with Sirolimus Eluting Stents (SES), Paclitaxel Eluting Stents (PES) or Everolimus Eluting Stents (EES) at a follow up period of 1 year, were continually being followed up in order to assess the long-term outcomes. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the long-term (2-5 years) adverse clinical outcomes which were associated with ZES versus SES, PES and EES following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were generated and the analysis was carried out by the RevMan 5.3 software. In this analysis with a total number of 17,606 participants, ZES and EES were associated with similar adverse outcomes including Stent Thrombosis (ST), myocardial infarction (MI), major adverse cardiac events and repeated revascularization. When ZES were compared with SES and PES during the long-term, MI and definite or probable ST were significantly lower with ZES, with RR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.17-1.56; P = 0.0001 and RR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.33-2.75; P = 0.0004 respectively whereas the other adverse outcomes were similarly manifested. Future research should be able to confirm this hypothesis.

28618984	Insulin	Hypoglycemia	0	0	0	0		Glycemic Variability and Insulin Needs in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Supplemented with Vitamin D: A Pilot Study Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring System.	BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that glycemic variability could influence the risk of complications in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). There are no data about the action of Vitamin D (VD) on glycemic variability. Our pilot study aims to evaluate glycemic variability and insulin needs in patients with T1DM supplemented with VD. METHODS: 22 Patients received doses of 4000 and 10000 IU/day of cholecalciferol for 12 weeks, according to the patient's baseline VD levels and underwent continuous glucose monitoring system. RESULTS: Correlations were found between percentage variation (Delta) of glycemia standard deviation (DeltaSDG), calculated using continuous glucose monitoring, with Delta of basal (r = 0.6; p <0.01) and total insulin dose (r = 0.6; p <0.01). Correlations between VD status after supplementation and Delta of prandial (r = 0.5; p <0.05) and total insulin dose (r = 0.4; p <0.05) were found, suggesting that the dose of insulin needed by patients is lower when VD status is better. We divided patients in two subgroups: SDG improved (subgroup 1; N = 12 (55%)) and SDG worsened (subgroup 2; N = 10 (45%)). Group 1, compared to subgroup 2, required a lower insulin dose (Deltabasal insulin dose = -8.0 vs. 6.3%; p <0.05) and had a lower frequency of hypoglycemia (27% vs. 64%, hypoglycemias/days evaluated; p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a relation between VD supplementation, improved glycemic variability, lower insulin needs and lower frequency of hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM.
29358327	Warfarin	Calcinosis	0	1	0	0		Low-level overexpression of p53 promotes warfarin-induced calcification of porcine aortic valve interstitial cells by activating Slug gene transcription.	The most frequently used oral anti-coagulant warfarin has been implicated in inducing calcification of aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs), whereas the mechanism is not fully understood. The low-level activation of p53 is found to be involved in osteogenic transdifferentiation and calcification of AVICs. Whether p53 participates in warfarin-induced AVIC calcification remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of low-level p53 overexpression in warfarin-induced porcine AVIC (pAVIC) calcification. Immunostaining, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting revealed that p53 was expressed in human and pAVICs and that p53 expression was slightly increased in calcific human aortic valves compared with non-calcific valves. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining indicated that apoptosis slightly increased in calcific aortic valves than in non-calcific valves. Warfarin treatment led to a low-level increase of p53 mRNA and protein in both pAVICs and mouse aortic valves. Low-level overexpression of p53 in pAVICs via an adenovirus vector did not affect pAVIC apoptosis but promoted warfarin-induced calcium deposition and expression of osteogenic markers. shRNA-mediated p53 knockdown attenuated the pAVIC calcium deposition and osteogenic marker expression. Moreover, ChIP and luciferase assays showed that p53 was recruited to the slug promoter and activated slug expression in calcific pAVICs. Of note, overexpression of Slug increased osteogenic marker Runx2 expression, but not pAVIC calcium deposition, and Slug knockdown attenuated pAVIC calcification and p53-mediated pAVIC calcium deposition and expression of osteogenic markers. In conclusion, we found that p53 plays an important role in warfarin induced pAVIC calcification, and increased slug transcription by p53 is required for p53-mediated pAVIC calcification.

Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a natural product commonly presented in food's composition, beverages and medicinal products. Generally, it is thought to be safe under normal dosage, yet it can be fatal in case of severe intoxication. We report a case of a healthy 32-year-old woman who went to the local emergency department (ED) 30 min after ingesting, accidentally, 5000 mg of anhydrous caffeine for a preworkout supplement. At the ED, she presented an episode of presyncope followed by agitation. ECG showed polymorphic broad complex QRS tachycardia and arterial blood gas revealed metabolic acidaemia with severe hypokalemia. The dysrhythmia was successfully treated with intravenous propranolol. Acid-base and hydroelectrolytic disorders were also corrected. A persistent sinus tachycardia was observed in the first 2 days in the ward and 5 days later she was discharged asymptomatic with internal medicine follow-up.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Planning dental extractions for Taiwanese patients on antithrombotic therapy remains controversial. This study aimed to examine management of dental extraction in patients on warfarin and antiplatelet therapy. METHODS: Subjects comprised 1331 patients, with (1) 60 on warfarin with intentional normalized ratio (INR) below 4.0 (warfarin continued: 28 patients/33 occasions; warfarin stopped and switched to heparin under hospitalization: 32 patients/37 occasions); (2) 183 on antiplatelet therapy (aspirin: 125 patients/185 occasions; clopidogrel: 42 patients/65 occasions; dual therapy: 16 patients/24 occasions); and (3) a control group of 1088 patients/1472 occasions without any antithrombotic therapy. The patient's clinico-demographic parameters, warfarin effectiveness (dose and INR levels) and antiplatelet therapy, number and type of dental extraction and incidence of postoperative bleeding were investigated. RESULTS: Incidence of postoperative bleeding in the warfarinized group (warfarin continued: 9.1%; warfarin stopped: 8.1%) was higher than in the antiplatelet group (aspirin: 1.1%; clopidogrel: 3.1%; dual antiplatelet: 4.2%), and the control group (0.7%), but these differences were not significant and unrelated to INR or number and type of dental extraction. Postoperative hemorrhage was managed successfully by repacking with Gelfoam impregnated with tranexamic acid powder in most patients. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that there is no need to interrupt warfarin (INR<4.0) and antiplatelet therapy before dental extractions in Taiwanese patients. A sufficient hemostasis could be obtained using local measures. This approach can save these individuals from becoming exposed to the risk of thromboembolism and the inconvenience of bridging anticoagulation with heparin.

30189827	Ketamine	Acidosis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Potential consequences of high-dose infusion of ketamine for refractory status epilepticus: case reports and systematic literature review.	Our goal was to provide comprehensive data on the effectiveness of ketamine in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) and to describe the potential consequences of long-term ketamine infusion. Ketamine, an N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, blocks excitatory pathways contributing to ongoing seizure. While ketamine use is standard in anaesthetic induction, no definitive protocol exists for its use in RSE, and little is known about its adverse effects in long-term, high-dose administration. We present two cases of RSE that responded rapidly to ketamine infusion, both with fatal outcomes secondary to metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular collapse. We performed a systematic review of the application and consequences of ketamine use in RSE. PubMed, Ovid, MEDLINE and PMC were searched for articles describing ketamine treatment for RSE according to a predetermined search strategy and inclusion criteria. The systematic review revealed wide discrepancies in ketamine dosing (infusion maintenance dose range 0.0075-10.5 mg/kg/hour), but good outcomes in medically managed RSE (75% of studies reported moderate or complete seizure control in adults, 62.5% in paediatrics). Additionally, literature review elucidated a potentially causal relationship between prolonged ketamine infusion and both cardiovascular and metabolic dysregulation. Ketamine is effective in RSE by antagonising excitotoxic NMDA receptors. However, there is high variability in ketamine dosing and scarce data on its safety in long-term infusion. Metabolic acidosis and haemodynamic instability associated with the use of long-term, high-dose ketamine infusions must be of concern to clinicians administering ketamine to critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: Short-term mucocutaneous adverse effects are well documented with imatinib. However, studies on long-term adverse effects and in the ethnic population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term mucocutaneous adverse effects of imatinib and factors predicting these adverse effects. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, consenting adult chronic myeloid leukemia patients on imatinib for more than 250 days were recruited. The details of imatinib treatment were retrieved from hematology clinic records. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-eight patients who were on imatinib for a mean duration of 1820 days were recruited. A mean number of 1.42 +/- 0.98 cutaneous adverse effects were seen per patient. Melasma-like pigmentation, periorbital edema, oral lichenoid reaction, cutaneous hypopigmentation, and vesicobullous eruptions were seen in 236 (53.9%), 81 (18.5%), 70 (16%), 42 (9.6%), and 12 (2.7%) patients, respectively. Drug-induced cutaneous eruptions (9.1%) and cutaneous hypopigmentation (9.6%) were seen less frequently. Cutaneous hyperpigmentation was more likely seen in younger patients (P = 0.001) and females (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, female gender was a significant risk factor for developing cutaneous hyperpigmentation and periorbital edema. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous hyperpigmentation and periorbital edema are common long-term adverse effects of imatinib in Indian patients. Female gender is a significant risk factor for the development of both these adverse effects.

Cutaneous hyperpigmentation was more likely seen in younger patients (P = 0.001) and females (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, female gender was a significant risk factor for developing cutaneous hyperpigmentation and periorbital edema. CONCLUSION: Cutaneous hyperpigmentation and periorbital edema are common long-term adverse effects of imatinib in Indian patients. Female gender is a significant risk factor for the development of both these adverse effects.

BACKGROUND: Short-term mucocutaneous adverse effects are well documented with imatinib. However, studies on long-term adverse effects and in the ethnic population are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term mucocutaneous adverse effects of imatinib and factors predicting these adverse effects. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, consenting adult chronic myeloid leukemia patients on imatinib for more than 250 days were recruited. The details of imatinib treatment were retrieved from hematology clinic records. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-eight patients who were on imatinib for a mean duration of 1820 days were recruited. A mean number of 1.42 +/- 0.98 cutaneous adverse effects were seen per patient. Melasma-like pigmentation, periorbital edema, oral lichenoid reaction, cutaneous hypopigmentation, and vesicobullous eruptions were seen in 236 (53.9%), 81 (18.5%), 70 (16%), 42 (9.6%), and 12 (2.7%) patients, respectively.

30677265	Levodopa	Bipolar Disorder	1	1	0	0	0.0	A Man Made Manic: Levodopa-Carbidopa-Induced Mania in Traumatic Brain Injury.	Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has had increased notoriety in light of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in professional sports. However, despite the increased rate at which mood disorders affect this population, there remains little information on management of these disorders. TBI has also been implicated in the development of Parkinson disease, increasing the likelihood that patients may be treated with dopaminergic agents. Management of coexisting pathologies can become challenging, especially when confounded by medication side effects. A case is presented of a 58-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in a manic state 15 years after having suffered a closed head injury. Several psychiatric admissions during the past 2 years were noted, with various diagnoses including different iterations of bipolar disorder. Among his medications, levodopa-carbidopa was present for an unsubstantiated Parkinson disease diagnosis. His mania resolved after discontinuation of the agent. This case is presented with a review of the relevant literature pertaining to the use of levodopa-carbidopa in this context, the use of other dopaminergic agents, and a biological hypothesis for the potential increased likelihood of manic symptoms in TBI patients who receive levodopa-carbidopa. Currently, there is a lack of research in this area, which emphasizes a need to review treatment guidelines for Parkinson disease patients with TBI.
29790482	Carrageenan	Inflammation	1	0	0	0		A study of enterocyte membranes during activation of apoptotic processes in chronic carrageenan-induced gastroenterocolitis.	Aim To investigate the lipid membranes of rat enterocytes in chronic carrageenan-induced gastroenterocolitis accompanied by the activation of apoptotic processes. Methods Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy: a study by fluorescent probes - by ortho-hydroxy derivatives of 2,5-diaryl-1,3- oxazole. Activity of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in small intestinal homogenates, blood serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and caspase-3 and the level of DNA fragmentation in small intestinal homogenates were determined. Results Biochemical analysis revealed that an activation of apoptotic processes occurred in the intestinal epithelium of rats during chronic carrageenan-induced gastroenterocolitis. The fluorescence probes showed that activation of apoptotic processes in carrageenan-induced gastroenterocolitis was accompanied by changes in polar regions of rat enterocyte membranes, while no changes were revealed in more hydrophobic regions of the membranes. Conclusion The increase in hydration of membranes was attributed to the activation of the apoptosis of enterocytes. It has been shown that a fluorescent probe (2-(2'-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3-oxazole) can be used for the detection of apoptosis of enterocytes.

29966612	Aspirin	Peptic Ulcer Hemorrhage	1	0	0	0		Misoprostol Heals Small Bowel Ulcers in Aspirin Users With Small Bowel Bleeding.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is no effective treatment for aspirin-induced small bowel ulcer bleeding. We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether misoprostol can heal small bowel ulcers in patients with small bowel bleeding who require continuous aspirin therapy. METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 84 aspirin users with small bowel bleeding who required continued aspirin therapy in Hong Kong and Japan. Patients with small bowel ulcers or multiple erosions, detected by capsule endoscopy, were randomly assigned to groups that received either misoprostol (200 mug, 4 times daily; n = 42) or placebo (n = 42) for 8 weeks. All patients continued taking aspirin (100 mg, once daily). The primary end point was complete ulcer healing at follow-up capsule endoscopy. Secondary end points included changes in hemoglobin level and number of ulcer/erosions from baseline. RESULTS: Complete healing of small bowel ulcers was observed in 12 patients in the misoprostol group (28.6%; 95% CI, 14.9%-42.2%) and 4 patients in the placebo group (9.5%; 95% CI, 0.6%-18.4%), for a difference in proportion of 19.0% (95% CI, 2.8%-35.3%; P = .026). The misoprostol group had a significantly greater mean increase in hemoglobin than the placebo group (mean difference, 0.70 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.05-1.36; P = .035). The reduction in medium number of ulcers or erosions was significantly greater in the misoprostol group (from 6.5 [range, 1-85] to 2 [range, 0-25]) than in the placebo group (from 7 [range, 1-29] to 4 [range, 0-19] (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we found misoprostol to be superior to placebo in promoting healing of small bowel ulcers among aspirin users complicated by small bowel ulcer bleeding who require continuous aspirin therapy. However, use of misoprostol alone would provide only limited protection against aspirin on the small bowel. ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01998776.

30384407	Uranium	Lung Neoplasms	1	1	0	0	0.0	Histopathologic Analysis of Lung Cancer Incidence Associated with Radon Exposure among Ontario Uranium Miners.	Although radon is a well-established contributor to lung cancer mortality among uranium miners, the effects of radon decay products on different histopathologies of lung carcinoma are not well established. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study aims to examine the risks of lung cancer by histological subtypes associated with exposure to radon decay products among the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort. Cases were stratified by histological groups, and associated risks were estimated for cumulative radon exposure after adjustment for attained age and calendar period. Between 1969 and 2005, 1274 incident cases of primary lung cancer were identified. Of these, 1256 diagnoses (99%) contained information on histology. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common (31%), followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), large cells (18%), small cell lung carcinoma (14%), and other or unspecified cell types (17%). Of the histological sub-groups, small cell lung carcinoma had the strongest association with cumulative radon exposure; compared to the reference group (<1 cumulative working level months (WLM)), the highest exposure category (>60 cumulative WLM) had a relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67(-)4.57). Adenocarcinoma had the lowest risk and was not significantly associated with exposure to radon decay products (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96(-)2.31). An increasing, linear trend in relative risk was noted with increasing cumulative WLM across small cell, squamous cell, and large cell lung carcinomas (P(trend) < 0.05). Similarly, the excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was highest for small cell lung carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.15, p < 0.01), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.12, p < 0.01). Non-statistically significant excess risk was observed for adenocarcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.004, p = 0.07). Our analysis of the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort data shows differences in the magnitude of the risks across four histological subtypes of lung carcinoma; the strongest association was noted for small cell lung carcinoma, followed by squamous cell, large cell, and lastly adenocarcinoma, which showed no significant associations with exposure to radon decay products.

30169374	Epoetin Alfa	Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure	1	1	0	0	0.0	"Investigating Serious Adverse Drug Reactions in Patients Receiving Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents: A Root Cause Analysis Using the ""ANTICIPATE"" Framework."	"BACKGROUND: Unexpected serious adverse drug reactions (sADRs) affecting patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were identified by study co-authors. These included pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) after administration of the Eprex formulation of epoetin or the epoetin biosimilar HX575 and fatal anaphylaxis associated with peginesatide, an erythropoietin receptor agonist. We developed and applied a structured framework to describe these sADRs, including root cause analyses and eradication efforts. METHODS: A 10-step framework termed ""ANTICIPATE,"" focusing on signal identification, incidence, causality, and eradication guided our evaluations. RESULTS: Initial cases were identified by a hematologist (Eprex), clinical study monitors (HX575), and 4 nurses (peginesatide). The number of persons with individual ADRs was 13 PRCA cases for epoetin, 2 antibody-mediated PRCA cases for HX575, and 5 fatal anaphylaxis cases for peginesatide. Initial incidence estimates per 1000 treated persons were 0.27 for Eprex-associated PRCA, 11 for HX575-associated PRCA, and 0.38 for peginesatide fatalities. Likely causes were subcutaneous administration of epoetin formulated with polysorbate 80 (Eprex), tungsten leaching from pins included in product syringes (HX575), and inclusion of a phenol stabilizer (peginesatide). Eradication strategies included restricting Eprex administration to the intravenous route, excluding tungsten from HX575 syringes, and for peginesatide, proposed eradication was to return to single-dose vials without preservatives. CONCLUSION: Although the number of cases of each sADR was small, eradication was successful for 2 sADRs, and a proposed eradication was developed for a third sADR. The structured framework used to describe the above 3 sADRs in patients with CKD can also be used in other clinical settings."
29434148	Polyethylene Glycols	Chondrocalcinosis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Pseudogout Attack after Pegfilgrastim Administration in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma.	A 67-year-old man with relapsed anaplastic large cell lymphoma received salvage chemotherapy, and pegfilgrastim was used to prevent febrile neutropenia. On day 18 of chemotherapy, he developed a pseudogout attack. Although the first symptoms improved, another pseudogout attack occurred when he received the second course of chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim. Filgrastim was then used for the third course of chemotherapy, and a pseudogout attack did not occur. The serum granulocyte-stimulating factor (G-CSF) level was extremely elevated only when pegfilgrastim was used, suggesting a relationship between pseudogout and G-CSF. Pseudogout should be recognized as an adverse effect of pegfilgrastim.

We report on a 21-year-old woman with a 3-year history of crusts and erosions on her scalp that had appeared after starting treatment with adalimumab due to Crohn's disease. By clinicopathological correlation pityriasis amiantacea with underlying folliculitis decalvans was diagnosed. Topical and systemic antibiotic treatment showed rapid response. The occurrence of pityriasis amiantacea in folliculitis decalvans associated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor therapy is remarkable and highlights the ambivalent role of TNF-alpha in diseases with immunological dysfunctions in combination with infections.
29538615	Benzene	Leukemia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Adductomic signatures of benzene exposure provide insights into cancer induction.	Although benzene has long been recognized as a cause of human leukemia, the mechanism by which this simple molecule causes cancer has been problematic. A complicating factor is benzene metabolism, which produces many reactive intermediates, some specific to benzene and others derived from redox processes. Using archived serum from 20 nonsmoking Chinese workers, 10 with and 10 without occupational exposure to benzene (exposed: 3.2-88.9 ppm, controls: 0.002-0.020 ppm), we employed an adductomic pipeline to characterize protein modifications at Cys34 of human serum albumin, a nucleophilic hotspot in extracellular fluids. Of the 47 measured human serum albumin modifications, 39 were present at higher concentrations in benzene-exposed workers than in controls and many of the exposed-control differences were statistically significant. Correlation analysis identified three prominent clusters of adducts, namely putative modifications by benzene oxide and a benzene diolepoxide that grouped with other measures of benzene exposure, adducts of reactive oxygen and carbonyl species, and Cys34 disulfides of small thiols that are formed following oxidation of Cys34. Benzene diolepoxides are potent mutagens and carcinogens that have received little attention as potential causes of human leukemia. Reactive oxygen and carbonyl species-generated by redox processes involving polyphenolic benzene metabolites and by Cyp2E1 regulation following benzene exposure-can modify DNA and proteins in ways that contribute to cancer. The fact that these diverse human serum albumin modifications differed between benzene-exposed and control workers suggests that benzene can increase leukemia risks via multiple pathways involving a constellation of reactive molecules.
29739318	Cilostazol	Hemorrhage	1	0	0	0		Safety of cilostazol in peripheral artery disease: a cohort from a primary healthcare electronic database.	BACKGROUND: Cilostazol has been associated with spontaneous reports of cardiovascular adverse events and serious bleeding. The objective of this study is to determine the relative risk of cardiovascular adverse events or haemorrhages in patients with peripheral artery disease treated with cilostazol in comparison to pentoxifylline users. METHODS: Population-based cohort study including all individuals older than 40 who initiated cilostazol or pentoxifylline during 2009-2011 in SIDIAP database. The two treatment groups were matched through propensity score (PS). RESULTS: Nine thousand one hundred twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria and after PS matching, there were 2905 patients in each group. 76% of patients were men, with similar mean ages in both groups (68.8 for cilostazol and 69.4 for pentoxifylline). There were no differences in bleeding, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with cilostazol were different from those treated with pentoxifylline at baseline, so they were matched through PS. We did not find differences between treatment groups in the incidence of bleeding or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Cilostazol should be used with precaution in elderly polymedicated patients.

29976896	Arsenic	Pregnancy Complications	1	0	0	0		Urinary Inorganic Arsenic Concentration and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnant Women from Arica, Chile.	Introduction: The association of total arsenic exposure with impaired glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes has been shown; however, evidence regarding urinary inorganic arsenic in pregnant women is still limited. Our aim was to evaluate the association between urinary inorganic arsenic concentration and gestational diabetes among pregnant women living in Arica, Chile. Methods: Cross-sectional study of pregnant women receiving care at primary health centers in urban Arica. The exposure was urinary inorganic arsenic concentration, while gestational diabetes was the outcome. The association was evaluated using multiple logistic regression models adjusted by age, education level, ethnicity, and pre-pregnancy body mass index. Results: 244 pregnant women were surveyed. The median urinary inorganic arsenic was 14.95 &mu;g/L, and the prevalence of gestational diabetes was 8.6%. After adjusting, we did not find a significant association between gestational diabetes and inorganic arsenic exposure tertiles (Odds ratio (OR) 2.98, 95% CI = 0.87(-)10.18), (OR 1.07, 95% CI = 0.26(-)4.33). Conclusion: This study did not provide evidence on the relationship between urinary inorganic arsenic concentration and gestational diabetes. Further research is needed to elucidate the factors underlying this association.
30148931	Bupropion	Ocular Motility Disorders	1	1	0	0	0.0	[Sustained upgaze in a patient who ingested high doses of bupropion. Report of one case].	Upgaze or sustained elevation of the eyes, is an alteration of ocular motility initially described in hypoxic coma. We report a 65-year-old woman admitted with hypotension and alteration of sensorium due to the ingestion of 9.5 g of Bupropion. She presented two seizures of short duration, without epileptic activity on the EEG. She had a persistent asynchronous myoclonus in extremities, tachycardia and prolonged Q-t. She suffered a cardiac arrest caused by asystole, which recovered quickly in five minutes. At that moment, upgaze appeared, associated with a persistent ocular opening, which persisted for days, but finally disappeared, without remission of coma. A magnetic resonance imaging done at the eighth day, showed hyperintensity of the oval center and corpus callosum which disappeared in a new imaging study done 30 days later, where images of hypoxia in the basal nuclei and cortex appeared. The patient died forty seven days after admission. Up-gaze is an ominous oculomotor alteration linked to an important but incomplete damage in the cerebral cortex, a condition that perverts some sequences of the ocular opening, reversing the Bell phenomenon and producing eyelid retraction.
29772097	Bevacizumab	Stroke	1	1	0	0	0.0	Would intravitreal bevacizumab injection increase risk of cerebral infarction?	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although studies have evaluated the relationship between intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injection and cerebral infarction (CI), the effects of IVB on CI are still not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IVB injection on patients with CI with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with AMD who received IVB injections for 1 year and determined the incidence of CI within 60 days after IVB injection to analyze the possible association between IVB and CI. RESULTS: A total of 263 patients were enrolled over a 12-month period. Six patients (2.28%) were diagnosed with CI within 2 months after receiving an IVB injection. The incidence of CI in patients of 75-84 years of age was 6.38%. These results showed a higher incidence for patients with IVB injections than the results of previous epidemiological studies (0.13% for all age groups, 1.68% for patients of 75-84 years of age). All CIs occurred 21-53 days after the IVB injection (mean: 39.33 +/- 14.65 days). Logistic regression analyses showed that age and CI history were factors associated with CI. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IVB might be an independent risk factor for CI. These results are useful for planning treatment strategies for patients with AMD and for prevention of CI.

28760404	Epinephrine	Retinal Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Retinal toxicity after accidental intravitreal injection of mepivacaine and adrenaline.	CASE REPORT: The case is presented of a 32 year-old male with no medical history of interest who suffered a traffic accident with mild traumatic brain injury. He had a left supraciliary incised and contused wound that extended to the left upper eyelid, with no loss of vision. After palpebral anaesthetic injection, there was a sudden visual acuity decrease in the left eye and hyposphagma located between I-III at 4mm from the limbus, with increased intraocular pressure. A whitish lesion with a central haemorrhagic focus was observed in the ocular fundus, corresponding to the area where the hyposphagma was located. DISCUSSION: Anaesthetic injection during palpebral repair may be complicated by inadvertent penetration of the eyeball. Intravitreal mepivacaine and adrenaline could cause macular and retinal lesions.
29921625	Bleomycin	Azoospermia	0	0	0	0		Genomic integrity in the male germ line: evidence in support of the disposable soma hypothesis.	The Big Blue lambdaSelect-cII selection system has been employed along with whole-exome sequencing to examine the susceptibility of the male germ line to mutation in two challenging situations (i) exposure to a chemotherapeutic regime including bleomycin, etoposide and cis-platinum (BEP) and (ii) the ageing process. A 3-week exposure to BEP induced complete azoospermia associated with a loss of developing germ cells and extensive vacuolization of Sertoli cell cytoplasm. Following cessation of treatment, spermatozoa first appeared in the caput epididymis after 6 weeks and by 12 weeks motile spermatozoa could be recovered from the cauda, although the count (P < 0.001) and motility (P < 0.01) of these cells were significantly reduced and superoxide generation was significantly elevated (P < 0.001). Despite this increase in free radical generation, no evidence of chromatin instability was detected in these spermatozoa. Furthermore, embryos obtained from females mated at this 12-week time point showed no evidence of an increased mutational load. Similarly, progressive ageing of Big Blue mice had no impact on the quality of the spermatozoa, fertility or mutation frequency in the offspring despite a significant increase in the mutational load carried by somatic tissues such as the liver (P < 0.05). We conclude that the male germ line is highly resistant to mutation in keeping with the disposable soma hypothesis, which posits that genetic integrity in the germ cells will be maintained at the expense of the soma, in light of the former's sentinel position in safeguarding the stability of the genome.

30073191	Fluoxetine	Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects	1	1	0	0	0.0	Examining the Reversibility of Long-Term Behavioral Disruptions in Progeny of Maternal SSRI Exposure.	Serotonergic dysregulation is implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders. Serotonin plays widespread trophic roles during neurodevelopment; thus perturbations to this system during development may increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological studies have examined association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy and increased autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring. It is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is purely related to maternal psychiatric diagnosis, or if treatment poses additional risk. We sought to determine whether maternal SSRI treatment alone or in combination with genetically vulnerable background was sufficient to induce offspring behavior disruptions relevant to ASD. We exposed C57BL/6J or Celf6(+/-) mouse dams to fluoxetine (FLX) during different periods of gestation and lactation and characterized offspring on tasks assessing social communicative interaction and repetitive behavior patterns including sensory sensitivities. We demonstrate robust reductions in pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and alterations in social hierarchy behaviors, as well as perseverative behaviors and tactile hypersensitivity. Celf6 mutant mice demonstrate social communicative deficits and perseverative behaviors, without further interaction with FLX. FLX re-exposure in adulthood ameliorates the tactile hypersensitivity yet exacerbates the dominance phenotype. This suggests acute deficiencies in serotonin levels likely underlie the abnormal responses to sensory stimuli, while the social alterations are instead due to altered development of social circuits. These findings indicate maternal FLX treatment, independent of maternal stress, can induce behavioral disruptions in mammalian offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of the developmental role of the serotonin system and the possible risks to offspring of SSRI treatment during pregnancy.

We report the case of a 50-year-old woman with anorexigen-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension treated with epoprostenol, who presented with Trousseau's sign, leading to the diagnosis of severe hypocalcemia for which substitution was started (initially orally, followed by intravenous substitution). After further analysis, we assume that epoprostenol-induced diarrhea caused malabsorption (as other reasons were excluded), leading to nutritional osteomalacia with secondary hyperparathyroidism. We discovered that even more severe hypocalcemia was induced by the treatment with the anti-osteoporotic drug denosumab, which was started after the diagnosis of osteoporosis on bone densitometry. In our opinion, clinicians have to be aware that in patients with malabsorption, antiresorptive therapy can induce dangerous and even life-threatening hypocalcemia, even in patients with normal renal function.

29337963	Afatinib	Diarrhea	0	0	0	0		Phase I open-label study of afatinib plus vinorelbine in patients with solid tumours overexpressing EGFR and/or HER2.	BACKGROUND: This phase Ib study evaluated afatinib plus vinorelbine in patients with advanced solid tumours overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or human EGFR 2 (HER2). METHODS: Maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) were determined for afatinib (20, 40 or 50 mg, once daily) combined with standard intravenous vinorelbine (part A; 25 mg m(-2) per week) or oral vinorelbine (part B; 60 mg m(-2) per week, increased to 80 mg m(-2) per week at week 3). Secondary end points for expanded MTD cohorts included assessments of safety, pharmacokinetics, tumour response and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The afatinib MTD was 40 mg with intravenous (MTD(A)) and oral (MTD(B)) vinorelbine. The most frequent cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities were febrile neutropenia and diarrhoea, consistent with individual safety profiles of vinorelbine and afatinib. Common treatment-related adverse events included: diarrhoea (92.7%), asthenia (76.4%), nausea (63.6%), neutropenia (56.4%) and vomiting (54.5%). No notable pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. Best overall tumour response was stable disease in part A (16 out of 28 patients), and partial response in part B (3 out of 27 patients). Median PFS was 14.6 and 15.9 weeks for patients treated at the MTD(A) and MTD(B), including dose-escalation and expansion cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Afatinib in combination with intravenous or oral vinorelbine demonstrated a manageable safety profile and antitumour activity at the MTD of 40 mg per day.

Although effective, these agents can be associated with adverse effects that may limit their use in some people. In the early 2000s, observations from clinical trials of prescription-strength and supratherapeutic doses of nonselective and cyclooxygenase-2-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) raised safety concerns regarding the risk of cardiovascular adverse effects with the use of these medications. Subsequently, the US Food and Drug Administration mandated additional study of the cardiovascular safety of NSAIDs for a more comprehensive understanding of their risk. As these data were being collected, and based on a comprehensive review of prescription data and the recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee, the warning labels of over-the-counter NSAIDs were updated to emphasize the potential cardiovascular risks of these agents. The recently reported ""Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety versus Ibuprofen or Naproxen"" (PRECISION) trial, in which participants with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and underlying cardiovascular risk factors were treated with prescription-strength celecoxib, ibuprofen, or naproxen, revealed similar rates of cardiovascular events (death from cardiovascular causes including hemorrhagic death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) among the 3 treatment groups. Although informative, the cardiovascular safety findings derived from PRECISION cannot be extrapolated to the safety of the over-the-counter pain relievers ibuprofen and naproxen, given that the doses used were higher (mean [standard deviation]: ibuprofen, 2045 [246] mg; naproxen, 852 [103] mg) and the durations of use longer ( approximately 20 months) than recommended with over-the-counter use of NSAIDs, which for ibuprofen is up to 10 days.

BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to assess the adverse reactions caused by multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective study of drug-related adverse reactions in 115 patients who were treated with sorafenib, sunitinib, and imatinib for primary hepatocellular carcinoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumors from October 2003 to March 2012 at the Peking University International Hospital. RESULTS: The total incidence of adverse reactions of sorafenib, sunitinib, and imatinib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors was > 80%. The main adverse reactions of sorafenib were hypertension in 38 patients (33.3%) and diarrhea in 28 patients (24.4%). Sunitinib was associated with higher incidence and greater grade 3-4 toxicity. The common toxicities were skin color changes in 105 patients (90.9%), hand-foot skin reactions in 65 patients (54.6%), and leukopenia (63.6%), hypertension (22.7%), proteinuria (22.7%), liver function impairment (22.7%), and hypomagnesemia (27.3%). While imatinib was well tolerated, it was associated with the highest number of adverse reactions, including skin color change (55.6%) and edema (38.9%). Hypophosphatemia (4.4%) and hoarseness (2.2%) only occurred in the sorafenib treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: The adverse reactions of multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments are generally mild to moderate, and most patients can tolerate these without the need for further intervention. Some serious adverse reactions may be alleviated by discontinuing the drugs or by administering symptomatic treatment.

30480761	Mefloquine	Vomiting	0	0	0	0		Mefloquine for preventing malaria in pregnant women.	BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for malaria for all women who live in moderate to high malaria transmission areas in Africa. However, parasite resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has been increasing steadily in some areas of the region. Moreover, HIV-infected women on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis cannot receive sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine because of potential drug interactions. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify alternative drugs for prevention of malaria in pregnancy. One such candidate is mefloquine. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of mefloquine for preventing malaria in pregnant women, specifically, to evaluate:* the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mefloquine for preventing malaria in pregnant women; and* the impact of HIV status, gravidity, and use of insecticide-treated nets on the effects of mefloquine. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the Malaria in Pregnancy Library, and two trial registers up to 31 January 2018. In addition, we checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies, unpublished data, confidential reports, and raw data from published trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing mefloquine IPT or mefloquine prophylaxis against placebo, no treatment, or an alternative drug regimen. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened all records identified by the search strategy, applied inclusion criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted trial authors to ask for additional information when required. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratios (RRs), count outcomes as incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MDs). We have presented all measures of effect with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following main outcomes of analysis: maternal peripheral parasitaemia at delivery, clinical malaria episodes during pregnancy, placental malaria, maternal anaemia at delivery, low birth weight, spontaneous abortions and stillbirths, dizziness, and vomiting. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials conducted between 1987 and 2013 from Thailand (1), Benin (3), Gabon (1), Tanzania (1), Mozambique (2), and Kenya (1) that included 8192 pregnant women met our inclusion criteria.Two trials (with 6350 HIV-uninfected pregnant women) compared two IPTp doses of mefloquine with two IPTp doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Two other trials involving 1363 HIV-infected women compared three IPTp doses of mefloquine plus cotrimoxazole with cotrimoxazole. One trial in 140 HIV-infected women compared three doses of IPTp-mefloquine with cotrimoxazole. Finally, one trial enrolling 339 of unknown HIV status compared mefloquine prophylaxis with placebo.Study participants included women of all gravidities and of all ages (four trials) or > 18 years (two trials). Gestational age at recruitment was > 20 weeks (one trial), between 16 and 28 weeks (three trials), or </= 28 weeks (two trials). Two of the six trials blinded participants and personnel, and only one had low risk of detection bias for safety outcomes.When compared with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, IPTp-mefloquine results in a 35% reduction in maternal peripheral parasitaemia at delivery (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86; 5455 participants, 2 studies; high-certainty evidence) but may have little or no effect on placental malaria infections (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.86; 4668 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). Mefloquine results in little or no difference in the incidence of clinical malaria episodes during pregnancy (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.05, 2 studies; high-certainty evidence). Mefloquine decreased maternal anaemia at delivery (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.94; 5469 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Data show little or no difference in the proportions of low birth weight infants (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.17; 5641 participants, 2 studies; high-certainty evidence) and in stillbirth and spontaneous abortion rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.58; 6219 participants, 2 studies; I(2) statistic = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). IPTp-mefloquine increased drug-related vomiting (RR 4.76, 95% CI 4.13 to 5.49; 6272 participants, 2 studies; high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (RR 4.21, 95% CI 3.36 to 5.27; participants = 6272, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence).When compared with cotrimoxazole, IPTp-mefloquine plus cotrimoxazole probably results in a 48% reduction in maternal peripheral parasitaemia at delivery (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.93; 989 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and a 72% reduction in placental malaria (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; 977 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) but has little or no effect on the incidence of clinical malaria episodes during pregnancy (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.76, 1 study; high-certainty evidence) and probably no effect on maternal anaemia at delivery (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.20; 1197 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), low birth weight rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.60; 1220 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and rates of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.98; 1347 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). Mefloquine was associated with higher risks of drug-related vomiting (RR 7.95, 95% CI 4.79 to 13.18; 1055 participants, one study; high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (RR 3.94, 95% CI 2.85 to 5.46; 1055 participants, 1 study; high-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Mefloquine was more efficacious than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in HIV-uninfected women or daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected pregnant women for prevention of malaria infection and was associated with lower risk of maternal anaemia, no adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes (such as stillbirths and abortions), and no effects on low birth weight and prematurity. However, the high proportion of mefloquine-related adverse events constitutes an important barrier to its effectiveness for malaria preventive treatment in pregnant women.
29784450	Cisplatin	Radiation Injuries	0	0	0	0		Physician assessed and patient reported urinary morbidity after radio-chemotherapy and image guided adaptive brachytherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer.	"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The EMBRACE study is a prospective multi-institutional study on MRI guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) in locally advanced cervix cancer (LACC). This analysis describes early to late urinary morbidity assessed by physicians and patients (PRO). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1176 patients were analysed. Median follow up (FU) was 27 (1-83) months. Morbidity (CTCAE v.3) and PRO (EORTC QLQ-C30&CX24) was prospectively assessed at baseline (BL), and during FU. RESULTS: The most frequent symptoms were frequency/urgency, incontinence, and cystitis with grade 2-4 prevalence rates of 4.3%, 5.0% and 1.7% and grade 1-4 prevalence rates of 24.5%, 16.1% and 5.8% at 3-years. The most frequent PRO endpoints were ""urinary frequency"" and ""leaking of urine"". Prevalence of ""Quite a bit"" or ""very much"" bother fluctuated from 14.0% to 21.5% for ""frequency"", while ""leaking of urine"" increased from 4.6% at BL to 9.3% at 3-years. Actuarial 3-year incidence of grade 3-4 urinary morbidity was 5.3% with most events being urinary frequency, incontinence and ureteral strictures. Grade 3-4 fistula, bleeding, spasm and cystitis were all <1.0% at 3/5-years. No grade 5 toxicity occurred. CONCLUSION: Urinary grade 3-4 morbidity with IGABT was limited. Urinary morbidity grade 2-4 comprises mainly frequency/urgency, incontinence and cystitis and has considerable prevalence in PRO.

The present study used an in vitro model of cold cardioplegia in isolated working rat hearts to evaluate the possible effects of two flavonoids, astragalin and dihydromyricetin, as adjuncts to histidine‑tryptophan‑ketoglutarate (HTK) cardioplegia. The following three groups of male Sprague Dawley rats were evaluated: The HTK group, treated with HTK alone; the HTK‑A group, treated with 10 micromol/l astragalin; and the HTK‑D group, treated with 10 micromol/l dihydromyricetin. Isolated rat hearts were perfused with Krebs‑Henseleit buffer for 30 min and incubated with the respective cardioplegic solution for 6 h at 4 C. Subsequently, astragalin or dihydromyricetin was added to the cardioplegic solutions. Following 30 min of reperfusion, the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), maximum up/down rate of left ventricular pressure (+/-dp/dtmax) and heart rate were documented as indices of myocardial function using a physiological recorder. Myocardial infarct size (IS) was estimated using 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) levels were also determined to assess the degree of cardiac injury. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis analysis was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin‑6 (IL‑6), tumor necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑alpha), C‑reactive protein (CRP) levels, as well as the glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) ratio were determined and analyzed using ELISA kits. The protein levels of caspase‑9 and B‑cell lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2) were determined using western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that exposure to astragalin or dihydromyricetin significantly improved the recovery of LVDP (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively), the +dP/dtmax (P<0.05 for dihydromyricetin only) and the ‑dP/dtmax (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively), increased SOD levels (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively) and GSH/GSSG ratios (P<0.05), reduced myocardial IS (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively), decreased CK, LDH, IL‑6 (all P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively), MDA (P<0.05), CRP (P<0.05) and TNF‑alpha levels (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively), increased Bcl‑2 levels (P<0.01) and decreased caspase‑9 levels (P<0.01). The results indicated that the addition of either flavonoid (particularly dihydromyricetin) to HTK enhances protection during ischemia, decreases myocardial dysfunction by enhancing anti‑inflammatory activities, attenuates myocardial oxidative injury and prevents apoptosis during ischemia/reperfusion.

29473172	Ceftriaxone	Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune	1	1	0	0	1.0	Ceftriaxone-induced drug reaction mimicking acute splenic sequestration crisis in a child with hemoglobin SC disease.	BACKGROUND: Acute splenic sequestration crisis is a complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) occurring when intrasplenic red blood cell (RBC) sickling prevents blood from leaving the spleen, causing acute splenic enlargement. Although typically seen in young children, it has been reported in older children with hemoglobin (Hb)SC disease, eventually resulting in functional asplenia. Ceftriaxone is a frequently used antibiotic of choice for children with SCD, because of its efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 9-year-old female with HbSC disease, who had a fatal reaction after receiving a dose of ceftriaxone in the outpatient clinic for fever. Her Hb level decreased abruptly from 9.3 to 2.3 mg/dL. RBC clumps with no visible hemolysis were observed in the postreaction sample. Autopsy examination revealed marked splenomegaly with acute congestion and sickled cells in the spleen and liver. Serologic testing revealed a positive direct antiglobulin test with polyspecific antibody, anti-C3, and anti-C3d, but negative with anti-immunoglobulin G. Ceftriaxone-dependent RBC antibodies were detected in her serum and RBC eluate when tested in the presence of the drug. CONCLUSION: We report a new presentation of ceftriaxone-induced drug reaction in a patient with SCD mimicking an acute splenic sequestration crisis. Review of the literature for cases of ceftriaxone-induced drug reactions in pediatric patients revealed nine previously reported cases of ceftriaxone-induced immune hemolytic anemia in children with SCD since 1995, but none with an initial presentation suggestive of acute splenic sequestration crisis.

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To report a case of persistent retinal toxicity associated with a high dose of sildenafil citrate intake. METHODS: Single retrospective case report. RESULTS: A 31-year-old white man with no medical history presented with complaints of bilateral multicolored photopsias and erythropsia (red-tinted vision), shortly after taking sildenafil citrate-purchased through the internet. Patient was found to have cone photoreceptor damage, demonstrated using electroretinogram, optical coherence tomography, and adaptive optics imaging. The patient's symptoms and the photoreceptor structural changes persisted for several months. CONCLUSION: Sildenafil citrate is a widely used erectile dysfunction medication that is typically associated with transient visual symptoms in normal dosage. At high dosage, sildenafil citrate can lead to persistent retinal toxicity in certain individuals.
30161312	Doxazosin	Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological	0	0	0	0		[Therapeutic effects of alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists on benign prostatic hyperplasia: A network meta-analysis].	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effects of commonly used selective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists (alpha-ARA) on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). METHODS: PubMed, Embase and CNKI databases were searched for the literature about selective alpha-ARAs for the treatment of BPH and the information was extracted on the common adverse reactions in the course of treatment. Multivariate meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of different alpha-ARAs. RESULTS: The total rates of adverse effects of silodosin and tamsulosin were the highest, 51.9% and 34.0% respectively, with the highest incidences of headache (38.3%), weakness (23.6%) and dizziness (17.5%). Besides, tamsulosin ranked the first in inducing sexual dysfunction of the male patients with BPH (70.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Doxazosin is preferable as the first-choice treatment of BPH for its therapeutic effect and improvement of the patient's quality of life. Silodosin and tamsulosin, however, can be selectively used according to the patient's specific tolerance to different adverse effects.
30212527	Betamethasone	Fetal Growth Retardation	1	1	0	0	0.0	Antenatal exposure to betamethasone induces placental 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 expression and the adult metabolic disorders in mice.	Antenatal overexposure to glucocorticoids causes fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and adult metabolic disorders. 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) 1 and 2 are key enzymes for glucocorticoid metabolism, however, the detailed effects of antenatal overexposure to glucocorticoids on placental 11beta-HSD1 and 2 expression and adult metabolic disorders remain obscure. Here, we report that, in placenta 11beta-HSD1 is diffusely localized, whereas 11beta-HSD2 is specifically expressed in labyrinthine layer. Exposure of pregnant dams to betamethasone significantly increases the expression of placental 11beta-HSD2 but not 11beta-HSD1, and decreases the weights of fetuses but not placentas. Antenatal exposure to betamethasone leads to either significant weight loss in the offspring younger than 10-week-old, or weight gain in those older than 14-week-old. Furthermore, antenatal exposure to betamethasone results in coexistence of various metabolic disorders in adult offspring, including hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, low insulin secretory capacity and hyperlipidemia. The present study demonstrates that exposure of pregnant dams to betamethasone induces the expression of placental 11beta-HSD2 but not 11beta-HSD1, leads to fetal IUGR and causes adult metabolic disorders, providing evidence for fetal origins of adult diseases and the potential role of placental 11beta-HSD2 in them.

Isolated arthralgia, without hemorrhagic side effect, exists and is considered as a very rare adverse drug reaction according to vitamin K antagonists' (VKAs) summary of product characteristics. Up to now, there are no literature reports of isolated, nonhemorrhagic joint complications in patients receiving VKAs. Hence, the objective of this study was to describe cases of VKA-related nonhemorrhagic joint disorders (fluindione, warfarin, and acenocoumarol) reported in the French Pharmacovigilance Database (FPVD). Sixty-one reports (male : female ratio, 1.18; median [interquartile range (IQR)] age: 60 [49-72]) were found. Fluindione, warfarin, and acenocoumarol were respectively suspected in 42, 12, and 7 cases. Arthralgia was reported in 47 cases (77%), arthritis in nine cases (15%), capsulitis in three cases (5%), and bursitis in two cases (3%). Although the joint symptoms mainly concerned the lower limbs, all types of joints were affected. Arthralgia was associated with myalgia in 14 cases and with tendinitis in three cases. The median (IQR) time interval between VKA introduction and arthralgia onset was 26 (10-98) days (range: 1-6935). VKA was withdrawn in 44 cases, and a decrease in the intensity of joint symptoms was observed in 30 cases. In three cases, reintroduction of the same VKA led to the recurrence of symptoms. In view of the large prescription of this drug class worldwide, patients and clinicians (and especially primary care physicians and geriatricians) should be aware of this possible adverse drug reaction when confronted with joint disorders in patients of all ages taking VKAs.

"INTRODUCTION: We assessed if patients with known hypoglycaemia present on other occasions with non-specific symptoms associated with (but not diagnosed as) hypoglycaemia, potentially representing missed hypoglycaemia. METHODS: 335 primary care records (5/2/12-4/2/13) from patients aged >65 (79 on insulin, 85 on sulphonylureas, 121 on metformin only, 50 without diabetes) were assessed for hypoglycaemia episodes and consultations with non-specific symptoms, ""hypo clues"". RESULTS: 27/79(34%) insulin-treated patients had >1 documented hypoglycaemia episode, compared to 4/85(5%) sulphonylurea-treated patients, 2/121(2%) metformin-only treated patients, and none without diabetes, p<0.001. ""Hypo clue"" consultations were common: 1.37 consultations/patient/year in insulin-treated patients, 0.98/patient/year in sulphonylurea-treated, 0.97/patient/year in metformin only-treated, and 0.78/patient/year in non-diabetic patients, p=0.34. In insulin-treated patients with documented hypoglycaemia, 20/27(74%) attended on another occasion with a ""hypo clue"" symptom, compared to 21/52(40%) of those without hypoglycaemia, p=0.008. No significant difference in the other treatment groups. Nausea, falls and unsteadiness were the most discriminatory symptoms: 7/33(21%) with hypoglycaemia attended on another occasion with nausea compared to 14/302(5%) without hypoglycaemia, p=0.002; 10/33(30%) vs 36/302(12%) with falls, p=0.007; and 5/33(15%) vs 13/302(4%) with unsteadiness, p=0.023. CONCLUSIONS: Non-specific symptoms are common in those >65 years. In insulin-treated patients at high hypoglycaemia risk, nausea, falls and unsteadiness should prompt consideration of hypoglycaemia."

29233604	Oxaliplatin	Hyperalgesia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Axonal excitability changes and acute symptoms of oxaliplatin treatment: In vivo evidence for slowed sodium channel inactivation.	OBJECTIVE: Neurotoxicity is the most frequent dose-limiting side effect of the anti-cancer agent oxaliplatin, but the mechanisms are not well understood. This study used nerve excitability testing to investigate the pathophysiology of the acute neurotoxicity. METHODS: Questionnaires, quantitative sensory tests, nerve conduction studies and nerve excitability testing were undertaken in 12 patients with high-risk colorectal cancer treated with adjuvant oxaliplatin and in 16 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Examinations were performed twice for patients: once within 3 days after oxaliplatin treatment (post-infusion examination) and once shortly before the following treatment (recovery examination). RESULTS: The most frequent post-infusion symptoms were tingling paresthesias and cold allodynia. The most prominent nerve excitability change was decreased superexcitability of motor axons which correlated with the average intensity of abnormal sensations (Spearman Rho = 0.80, p < .01). The motor nerve excitability changes were well modeled by a slowing of sodium channel inactivation, and were proportional to dose/m(2) with a half-life of about 10d. CONCLUSIONS: Oxaliplatin induces reversible slowing of sodium channel inactivation in motor axons, and these changes are closely related to the reversible cold allodynia. However, further studies are required due to small sample size in this study. SIGNIFICANCE: Nerve excitability data provide an index of sodium channel dysfunction: an objective biomarker of acute oxaliplatin neurotoxicity.
29532621	Fluorouracil	Hyperpigmentation	0	0	0	0		Comparison between the efficacy of microneedling combined with 5-fluorouracil vs microneedling with tacrolimus in the treatment of vitiligo.	BACKGROUND: Several treatment modalities had been used for the treatment of vitiligo, but the optimal treatment has not yet been identified. OBJECTIVES: To study the efficacy of microneedling with 5-flurouracil vs its efficacy with tacrolimus in the treatment of vitiligo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with vitiligo were subjected to microneedling of 2 patches of vitiligo with dermapen, then application of 5-fluorouracil to 1 patch and tacrolimus on the other patch. This procedure was repeated every 2 weeks for every patient for maximum 6 months (12 sessions). The patients were followed up for 3 months after the last session. RESULTS: The overall repigmentation was significantly higher in 5-fluorouracil-treated patches compared with tacrolimus. Excellent improvement occurred in 48% of 5- flurouracil-treated patches while only in 16% of tacrolimus-treated patches. In the acral parts, 40% of the patches treated with 5-fluorouracil achieved excellent improvement (repigmentation >75%), while no patch in the acral parts achieved excellent improvement with tacrolimus. However, there was significant difference between the 2 drugs,regarding inflammation, ulceration, and hyperpigmentation which occurred with 5-fluorouracil. CONCLUSION: Microneedling combined with 5-fluorouracil or tacrolimus is safe and effective treatment of vitiligo. However, 5-fluorouracil achieved a greater percentage of repigmentation than tacrolimus particularly in the acral parts.

BACKGROUND: Several treatment modalities had been used for the treatment of vitiligo, but the optimal treatment has not yet been identified. OBJECTIVES: To study the efficacy of microneedling with 5-flurouracil vs its efficacy with tacrolimus in the treatment of vitiligo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with vitiligo were subjected to microneedling of 2 patches of vitiligo with dermapen, then application of 5-fluorouracil to 1 patch and tacrolimus on the other patch. This procedure was repeated every 2 weeks for every patient for maximum 6 months (12 sessions). The patients were followed up for 3 months after the last session. RESULTS: The overall repigmentation was significantly higher in 5-fluorouracil-treated patches compared with tacrolimus. Excellent improvement occurred in 48% of 5- flurouracil-treated patches while only in 16% of tacrolimus-treated patches. In the acral parts, 40% of the patches treated with 5-fluorouracil achieved excellent improvement (repigmentation >75%), while no patch in the acral parts achieved excellent improvement with tacrolimus. However, there was significant difference between the 2 drugs,regarding inflammation, ulceration, and hyperpigmentation which occurred with 5-fluorouracil. CONCLUSION: Microneedling combined with 5-fluorouracil or tacrolimus is safe and effective treatment of vitiligo.

29667796	Isotretinoin	Depression	1	1	0	0	0.0	Isotretinoin: the ups are just as troubling as the downs.	"INTRODUCTION: Isotretinoin, previously marketed as Accutane(R), is an oral retinoid medication that is used to treat acne and other cutaneous disorders. Although the data is conflicting, previous reports suggest a causal relationship between isotretinoin and depression. When reviewing these previous reports, many patients who were diagnosed as ""depressed"" did not undergo a thorough psychiatric evaluation and/or were not diagnosed according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). These patients reported agitation, irritability, sleep disturbances, and aggression. We hypothesize that some patients previously reported as ""depressed"" may have been ""misdiagnosed"" and were actually experiencing symptoms of mania, mixed mood (depression and mania at the same time), or psychosis. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: An Ovid Medline and PubMed literature search of English language articles was performed using the keywords ""isotretinoin"", ""retinoids"", ""mood"", ""psychiatric"", ""depression"", ""elevation"", ""bipolar"", and ""psychosis"". Eleven case reports, three case series, three retrospective chart reviews, five drug registries, and two prospective studies were reviewed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We found that many of the patients labeled as ""depressed"", had signs of activation, agitation, elevated mood, and psychosis. We believe that many of these patients were most likely having manic or mixed mood episodes. These symptoms appeared to be more prevalent in patients with a personal or family history of mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: Isotretinoin may cause mood instability in both directions - depression and mania - especially in a predisposed population. With this in mind, we urge clinicians prescribing isotretinoin to focus on all psychiatric symptoms (not just depression) including mania, mixed mood, and psychosis, paying particular attention to individuals who have a personal or family history of psychiatric disease."
29309397	Tenofovir	Osteoporosis	0	0	0	0		Assessment of bone mineral density in patients with cirrhosis treated with third-generation nucleos(t)ide analogues: comparison between tenofovir and entecavir.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Tenofovir and entecavir are nowadays the first-line treatment in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis. Both drugs were shown to be effective in HBV suppression and well tolerated. The effects of tenofovir on bone mineral density (BMD), however, were shown to worsen the rate of osteoporosis, which is already a common feature in cirrhosis. In contrast, entecavir seems to have no effect on mineral metabolism. The aim of our study was to compare the effects of nucleos(t)ide analogs on bone density in HBV-related cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourty-eight patients were treated with tenofovir and 22 patients were treated with entecavir, and were followed prospectively from 2008 to 2013. To evaluate BMD, laboratory examinations, dual-X-ray absorptiometry, and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool were assessed. RESULTS: During the study, no difference was found between the two groups in the plasmatic concentration of calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, or creatinine. Dual-X-ray absorptiometry showed no difference in the T-score and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool showed no significant difference in the 10-year risk of osteoporotic fractures in the two groups. On univariate and multivariate analyses, the only predictors of osteoporosis development were the prognostic scores of liver disease and BMI. CONCLUSION: Both tenofovir and entecavir are effective in treating HBV in cirrhotic patients. The known effects of tenofovir on BMD do not worsen osteoporotic fractures risk compared with entecavir in these patients.

29909472	Dutasteride	Erectile Dysfunction	1	1	0	0	0.0	The Impact of 5alpha-Reductase Inhibitor Use for Male Pattern Hair Loss on Men's Health.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Male pattern hair loss, mediated by dihydrotestosterone, is a common hair loss disorder, affecting over 50% of men over the age of 50. The 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, finasteride and dutasteride, are Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of this disorder. Several recent studies have reported adverse sexual and spermatogenic events among young men using 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, such as erectile dysfunction, decreased ejaculate volume, decreased libido, and infertility. In this review, we summarize and analyze the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of these medications, with an overall focus on men's health. RECENT FINDINGS: Finasteride for the treatment of male pattern hair loss was considered safe according to many previous clinical trials. However, these trials have been recently criticized for inadequate safety reporting. Comprehensive review of the current literature reveals that there is a disproportionately high number of men with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor-associated sexual dysfunction and infertility. Although uncommon, the use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors is associated with serious and persistent sexual and reproductive side effects, such as erectile dysfunction, decreased ejaculate volume, decreased libido, and infertility.

29260270	Hyaluronic Acid	Necrosis	1	1	1	1	1.0	Vascular Complications After Chin Augmentation Using Hyaluronic Acid.	Vascular complications after hyaluronic acid (HA) filling of the chin have rarely been reported. In this report, two cases of vascular occlusion after HA augmentation of the mentum are presented. The first case involved local skin necrosis that resulted from a massive microcirculatory embolism and/or external compression of the chin skin microvasculature. The second case involved vascular compromise in the tongue that resulted from HA injection in the chin. The diagnosis was established on the basis of interventional angiography findings. Concerning the pathogenesis, we hypothesized that the filler embolus flowed into the branches of the deep lingual artery through the rich vascular anastomoses among the submental, sublingual, and deep lingual arteries, after being accidentally injected into the submental artery (or its branches).

30431741	Ipilimumab	Autoimmune Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Hypophysitis and other autoimmune complications related to immune checkpoints inhibitors  treatment: Spectrum of imaging appearances.	OBJECTIVES: Immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICI) represent a new therapy option for the treatment of several advanced tumors. However, this therapy has been linked to a spectrum of ICI related autoimmune (AI) adverse events. Some may be life threatening and their diagnosis is tricky. The aim of our study was to describe various imaging appearances of ICI related secondary hypophysitis and other coincidental AI diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included 28 patients (19 females, 9 men, mean aged 58+/-13 years), who were consecutively treated mostly for advanced stage melanoma by different ICI. All their CT/MRI records and clinical data were reviewed. RESULTS: We found 5 (18%) cases of endocrinology proven secondary hypophysitis; 2 cases of panhypopituitarism and 3 cases of central hypocortisolism. Four cases were MRI positive, 1 case was MRI negative. Three cases were accompanied by other AI diseases: 1 by hemorrhagic colitis and mesenterial lymphadenitis, 1 by AI pancreatitis and 1 by pneumonitis. On MRI pituitary gland was swollen in 3 cases, twice enhanced non-homogenously, once homogenously; infundibular enlargement was present in 2 cases. Those 3 cases reacted to glucocorticoid therapy by hypophyseal shrinkage. In 1 case of MRI positive hypophysitis, the pituitary gland was not enlarged, slightly nonhomogeneous with peripheral contour enhancement; no reaction to glucocorticoids was mentioned. CONCLUSION: Secondary hypophysitis is probably more common ICI related adverse event than reported in the literature. Its MRI appearance is variable. Most of our cases were in coincidence with other AI ICI related events that affected their clinical manifestations.

"BACKGROUND: The authors clarified the causal mechanisms underlying the high prevalence of dental disease encountered in people who habitually use methamphetamine (meth). METHODS: Using a stratified sampling approach, the authors conducted comprehensive oral examinations and psychosocial assessments for 571 study participants who used meth. Three calibrated dentists, who used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) protocols, characterized the study participants' dental disease. The authors also collected data related to study participants' history of meth use and other attributes linked to dental disease. RESULTS: Study participants who used meth manifested higher rates of xerostomia and caries experience compared with NHANES control participants. Participants who used meth had a higher level of daily consumption of sugary beverages compared with NHANES control participants. Smoking meth did not increase caries experience over other modes of intake. Dental hygiene was a significant determinant of dental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Mode of intake and frequency of meth use have a minimal impact on dental health outcomes. Behaviors, such as sugary beverage consumption and poor oral hygiene, better explain dental health outcomes. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Having a better understanding of the causal mechanisms of ""meth mouth"" sets the stage for clinicians to provide more personalized interventions and management of dental disease in people who use meth."

Additional inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis by accumulation of the drug may aggravate fasting-induced ketoacidosis. We report the occurrence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) with concurrent euglycemic ketoacidosis (MALKA) in three patients with renal failure. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Patient 1: a 78-year-old woman (pH = 6.89, lactic acid 22 mmol/l, serum ketoacids 7.4 mmol/l and blood glucose 63 mg/dl) on metformin and insulin treatment. Patient 2: a 79-year-old woman on metformin treatment (pH = 6.80, lactic acid 14.7 mmol/l, serum ketoacids 6.4 mmol/l and blood glucose 76 mg/dl). Patient 3: a 71-year-old man on metformin, canagliflozin and liraglutide treatment (pH = 7.21, lactic acid 5.9 mmol/l, serum ketoacids 16 mmol/l and blood glucose 150 mg/dl). In all patients, ketoacidosis receded on glucose infusion and renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: This case series highlights the parallel occurrence of MALA and euglycemic ketoacidosis, the latter exceeding ketosis due to starvation, suggesting a metformin-triggered inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Affected patients benefit from glucose infusion counteracting suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Patient 3: a 71-year-old man on metformin, canagliflozin and liraglutide treatment (pH = 7.21, lactic acid 5.9 mmol/l, serum ketoacids 16 mmol/l and blood glucose 150 mg/dl). In all patients, ketoacidosis receded on glucose infusion and renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSION: This case series highlights the parallel occurrence of MALA and euglycemic ketoacidosis, the latter exceeding ketosis due to starvation, suggesting a metformin-triggered inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Affected patients benefit from glucose infusion counteracting suppressed hepatic gluconeogenesis.
28865058	Metformin	Ketosis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Combined metformin-associated lactic acidosis and euglycemic ketoacidosis.	BACKGROUND: In renal failure metformin can lead to lactic acidosis. Additional inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis by accumulation of the drug may aggravate fasting-induced ketoacidosis. We report the occurrence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) with concurrent euglycemic ketoacidosis (MALKA) in three patients with renal failure. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Patient 1: a 78-year-old woman (pH = 6.89, lactic acid 22 mmol/l, serum ketoacids 7.4 mmol/l and blood glucose 63 mg/dl) on metformin and insulin treatment. Patient 2: a 79-year-old woman on metformin treatment (pH = 6.80, lactic acid 14.7 mmol/l, serum ketoacids 6.4 mmol/l and blood glucose 76 mg/dl).

Preclinical data suggest that combining a checkpoint inhibition with immunomodulatory derivative can increase anticancer response. We designed a dose-escalation study using a 3 + 3 design to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (R2PD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab (1.5-3 mg/kg intravenously every 28 days x 4) and lenalidomide (10-25 mg orally daily for 21 of 28 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) in advanced cancers. Total of 36 patients (Hodgkin lymphoma, 7; melanoma, 5; leiomyosarcoma, 4; renal cancer, 3; thyroid cancer, 3; other cancers, 14; median of 3 prior therapies) were enrolled. The MTD has not been reached and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg and lenalidomide 25 mg have been declared as R2PD. DLT were grade (G) 3 rash (3 patients) and G3 pancreatitis (1 patient). G3/4 drug-related toxicities other than DLT were G3 anemia (5 patients), G3 thromboembolism (2 patients), G3 thrombocytopenia, G3 rash, G3 hypopituitarism, G3 pneumonitis, G3 transaminitis, and G4 hypopituitarism (all in 1 patient). Eight patients had tumor shrinkage per immune-related response criteria (-79% to -2%) including a PR (-79% for 7.2+ months) in a refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Using comprehensive genomic profiling, a total mutation burden (mutations/Mb) was evaluated in 17 patients, with one of the patients achieving a PR demonstrated intermediate mutation burden. In conclusion, combination of ipilimumab and lenalidomide is well tolerated and demonstrated preliminary signals of activity in patients with refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and other advanced cancers.

29530667	Axitinib	Myocarditis	0	0	0	0		Preliminary results for avelumab plus axitinib as first-line therapy in patients with advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (JAVELIN Renal 100): an open-label, dose-finding and dose-expansion, phase 1b trial.	BACKGROUND: The combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF pathway inhibitor to treat patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma might increase the clinical benefit of these drugs compared with their use alone. Here, we report preliminary results for the combination of avelumab, an IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the programmed cell death protein ligand PD-L1, and axitinib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor approved for second-line treatment of advanced renal-cell carcinoma, in treatment-naive patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma. METHODS: The JAVELIN Renal 100 study is an ongoing open-label, multicentre, dose-finding, and dose-expansion, phase 1b study, done in 14 centres in the USA, UK, and Japan. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (>/=20 years in Japan) and had histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced renal-cell carcinoma with clear-cell component, life expectancy of at least 3 months, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less, received no previous systemic treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma, and had a resected primary tumour. Patients enrolled into the dose-finding phase received 5 mg axitinib orally twice daily for 7 days, followed by combination therapy with 10 mg/kg avelumab intravenously every 2 weeks and 5 mg axitinib orally twice daily. Based on the pharmacokinetic data from the dose-finding phase, ten additional patients were enrolled into the dose-expansion phase and assigned to this regimen. The other patients in the dose-expansion phase started taking combination therapy directly. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities in the first 4 weeks (two cycles) of treatment with avelumab plus axitinib. Safety and antitumour activity analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of avelumab or axitinib. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02493751. FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2015, and Sept 30, 2016, we enrolled six patients into the dose-finding phase and 49 into the dose-expansion phase of the study. One dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 proteinuria due to axitinib was reported among the six patients treated during the dose-finding phase. At the cutoff date (April 13, 2017), six (100%, 95% CI 54-100) of six patients in the dose-finding phase and 26 (53%, 38-68) of 49 patients in the dose-expansion phase had confirmed objective responses (32 [58%, 44-71] of all 55 patients). 32 (58%) of 55 patients had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events, the most frequent being hypertension in 16 (29%) patients and increased concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, amylase, and lipase, and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome in four (7%) patients each. Six (11%) of 55 patients died before data cutoff, five (9%) due to disease progression and one (2%) due to treatment-related autoimmune myocarditis. At the end of the dose-finding phase, the maximum tolerated dose established for the combination was avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks and axitinib 5 mg twice daily. INTERPRETATION: The safety profile of the combination avelumab plus axitinib in treatment-naive patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma seemed to be manageable and consistent with that of each drug alone, and the preliminary data on antitumour activity are encouraging. A phase 3 trial is assessing avelumab and axitinib compared with sunitinib monotherapy. FUNDING: Pfizer and Merck.
30577200	Mycophenolic Acid	Hyperlipidemias	1	0	0	0		Comparison of Sirolimus Combined With Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil Combined With Tacrolimus in Kidney Transplantation Recipients: A Meta-Analysis.	PURPOSE: The study was designed to compare the outcomes of sirolimus (SRL) combined with tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) combined with TAC in kidney transplantation recipients. METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was performed to identify relevant studies, and the last update was on February 1, 2018. All studies with appropriate data comparing the SRL group with the MMF group were included. SRL and MMF were used in sufficient doses. Relevant information was recorded and analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the effects of SRL and MMF. Relevant outcomes, including delayed graft function, acute rejection, graft survival, seroma, anemia, lymphocele, and hyperlipidemia, were compared. RESULTS: Ten studies with a total of 2357 patients (n = 1256 receiving SRL vs n = 1101 receiving MMF) were ultimately included. Our results indicated that the SRL group experienced a higher rate of hyperlipidemia (OR: 1.864; 95% CI, 1.494-2.325) and lymphocele (OR: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.49-4.47). However, no significant differences were detected regarding the rates of delayed graft function, acute rejection, graft survival, infectious complications, anemia, or seroma. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that SRL combined with TAC and MMF combined with TAC were equally safe and effective for the kidney transplantation recipients. However, the MMF group exhibited a marginally significant advantage of lower incidence of hyperlipidemia and lymphocele.

29631026	Soybean Oil	Inflammation	0	0	0	0		High level of dietary soybean oil depresses the growth and anti-oxidative capacity and induces inflammatory response in large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea.	Increasing demand, uncertain availability and high price of fish oil with the expansion of aquaculture made it essential to search alternative lipid sources. Vegetable oil has been proved to be the best candidate for the replacement of fish oil in aquafeeds. However, this replacement especially in high level potentially has some negative effects on fish. The present study was conducted to investigate the growth performance, anti-oxidative and inflammatory responses of large yellow croaker to replacement of dietary fish oil by soybean oil. Three isonitrogenous (46% crude protein) and isolipidic (13% crude lipids) diets were formulated to feed fish (initial body weight: 36.80 +/- 0.39 g) for 12 weeks. The control diet was designed to contain 6.5% of fish oil, and named as FO. On the basis of the control diet, the fish oil was 50% and 100% replaced by soybean oil, and these two diets were named as FS and SO, respectively. Results showed that the specific growth rate significantly decreased in the SO group. Crude lipid contents in muscle and liver of fish fed SO diet were significantly higher than those in the FO group. The ratio of n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to identified fatty acids in liver decreased significantly, while n-6 PUFAs increased significantly with increasing dietary soybean oil inclusion. The levels of triacylglycerol, non-esterified fatty acid and tumour necrosis factor alpha, and the activity of aspartate aminotransferase in serum significantly increased in SO group. The total anti-oxidative capacity and expressions of the anti-oxidation-related genes (superoxide dismutase 1 and 2, catalase, glutathion peroxidase and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) were significantly decreased by dietary soybean inclusion. Dietary soybean oil significantly decreased the gene expressions of the anti-inflammatory cytokines (arginase I and interleukin 10), and increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta). The replacement of dietary fish oil by soybean oil also induced an over-expression of toll-like receptor 22 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 in liver. In conclusion, dietary soybean oil could suppress growth performance and liver anti-oxidative capacity, and induce inflammatory responses of large yellow croaker.

BACKGROUND: Hydrochlorothiazide, one of the most frequently used diuretic and antihypertensive drugs in the United States and Western Europe, is photosensitizing and has previously been linked to lip cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between hydrochlorothiazide use and the risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: From the Danish Cancer Registry, we identified patients (cases) with nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) during 2004-2012. Controls were matched 1:20 by age and sex. Cumulative hydrochlorothiazide use (in 1995-2012) was assessed from the Danish Prescription Registry. Using conditional logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for BCC and SCC associated with hydrochlorothiazide use. RESULTS: High use of hydrochlorothiazide (>/=50,000 mg) was associated with ORs of 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI, 3.68-4.31) for SCC. We found clear dose-response relationships between hydrochlorothiazide use and both BCC and SCC; the highest cumulative dose category (>/=200,000 mg of HCTZ) had ORs of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.38-1.71) and 7.38 (95% CI, 6.32-8.60) for BCC and SCC, respectively. Use of other diuretics and antihypertensives was not associated with NMSC. LIMITATIONS: No data on sun exposure were available. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrochlorothiazide use is associated with a substantially increased risk of NMSC, especially SCC.

29653592	Amiodarone	Liver Cirrhosis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Amiodarone-induced reversible and irreversible hepatotoxicity: two case reports.	BACKGROUND: Amiodarone is a highly effective treatment for supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmia; however, it could be associated with several serious adverse effects, including liver injury. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical and histological features of two contrasting Japanese patients with amiodarone-induced reversible and irreversible hepatotoxicity. One patient with amiodarone-induced irreversible hepatotoxicity showed liver cirrhosis during treatment with amiodarone and died of hepatic failure; the other patient, who had reversible hepatotoxicity, showed a reversible course of liver function and imaging after discontinuation of amiodarone. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the importance of close monitoring of liver enzymes and evaluation of liver computed tomographic imaging as well as liver biopsy during treatment with amiodarone, and discontinuation should be considered when amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity is suspected.

It is well established and documented that fluoroquinolone use is associated with the development of tendinopathy. However, little is known about the possible effects of this class of antibiotics on the orbit. We present a case of lateral canthal tendon rupture that presented with an acute right lower eyelid ectropion in a young, renal compromised patient in the setting of recent fluoroquinolone use for pneumonia. Eye care clinicians need to be aware of the possible effects of fluoroquinolones on the eyelids.
27550304	Rituximab	Neoplasms	0	0	0	0		The incidence of cancer in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and a prior malignancy who receive TNF inhibitors or rituximab: results from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register-Rheumatoid Arthritis.	OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy and rituximab (RTX) upon the incidence of cancer in patients with RA and prior malignancy. METHODS: The study population comprised RA subjects with a prior malignancy reported to the UK national cancer registers, recruited to the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register from 2001 to 2013. We compared rates of first incident malignancy in a TNFi cohort, RTX cohort and synthetic DMARDs (sDMARD) cohort. RESULTS: We identified 425 patients with a prior malignancy from 18 000 RA patients in the study. Of these, 101 patients developed a new malignancy. The rates of incident malignancy were 33.3 events/1000 person-years (py) in the TNFi cohort, 24.7 events/1000 py in the RTX cohort and 53.8 events/1000 py in the sDMARD cohort. The age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.86) for the TNFi cohort and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.10, 1.80) for the RTX cohort in comparison with the sDMARDs cohort. The 17.0% of patients in the sDMARDs cohort had a recurrence of the same cancer in comparison with the 12.8% and the 4.3% in the TNFi and RTX cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although numbers are still low, it seems that patients with RA and prior malignancy selected to receive either a TNFi or RTX in the UK do not have an increased risk of future incident malignancy.

BACKGROUND: Autoimmune thyroid disease and thyroid dysfunction are common in adults receiving interferon (IFN)-based treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Few data are available in children with CHC. This study is aimed to evaluate the appearance and timing of thyroid dysfunction and antithyroid autoimmunity in children with CHC treated with pegylated IFN-alpha-2b and ribavirin (RBV). METHODS: Sixty-one otherwise healthy children with CHC, 3-17 years of age, infected perinatally and treatment naive, receiving therapy with pegylated IFN-alpha-2b and RBV and 183 age- and sex-matched controls were included in a multicenter, prospective, case-control study. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, antithyroglobulin antibodies and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies were assessed before, during and 24 weeks after the end of treatment. RESULTS: From baseline to the end of treatment, subclinical hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroiditis were diagnosed in 17 of 61 (27.94%) and in 4 of 61 (6.6%) of the children treated, respectively, and in 5 of 183 (2.7%) and in none of the controls (P < 0.0001, relative risk: 10.2, 95% confidence interval: 3.9-26.5; P = 0.03, relative risk: 26.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.5-489.1, respectively). Twenty-four weeks after the end of treatment, subclinical hypothyroidism persisted in only 4 of 61 (6.6%). Autoimmune thyroiditis persisted in 3 of 4 (75%) of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical hypothyroidism is common in children with CHC receiving treatment with pegylated IFN-alpha-2b and RBV, but in most cases is transient. Autoimmune thyroiditis, which is less common, generally persists after treatment completion. Thyroid function should be carefully monitored in patients presenting with antithyroid autoantibodies and thyroid dysfunction during and after pegylated IFN-alpha-based treatment.

30536299	Paliperidone Palmitate	Hyponatremia	1	1	0	0	0.0	[The syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) ending lethal during the use of paliperidon and lamotrigine].	Hyponatremia, as a result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), is well known with the use of nearly all antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. The first symptoms are atypical and are not always mentioned by the patient. However, not recognising the syndrome in due time can be lethal. We describe a 35-year-old woman who died due to lack of recognition of SIADH. The patient, who had a bipolar disorder and was for a long time on a paliperidone depot, developed complaints of nausea, vomiting and thirst after lamotrigine was prescribed. A few days after increasing the dose, she died; no evidence was found of suicide. The SIADH was probably triggered by the use of lamotrigine and paliperidone. Paying sufficient attention to the symptoms that may cause this syndrome, as well as their early recognition, could save lives.

29956746	Glycerol	Hematologic Diseases	0	0	0	0		Liposomal paclitaxel induces fewer hematopoietic and cardiovascular complications than bioequivalent doses of Taxol.	Paclitaxel (PTX) exhibits potent antineoplastic activity against various human malignancies; however, clinical application must overcome the inherent hydrophobicity of this molecule. The commercialized Taxol formulation utilizes Cremophor EL (CrEL)/ethanol as a solvent to stabilize and dispense PTX in an aqueous solution. However, adverse CrEL‑induced hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in ~30% of recipients, and 40% of patients receiving premedication may also experience this adverse effect. Therefore, the development of a CrEL-free delivery system is crucial, in order to fully exploit the therapeutic efficacy of PTX. In the present study, a novel liposomal PTX (lipo‑PTX) formulation was optimized with regards to encapsulation rate and long‑term stability, arriving at a molar constituent ratio of soybean phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol:N-(carbonyl-methoxy-poly-ethylene glycol 2000)‑1,2‑distearoyl‑sn-glycero‑3-phosphoethanolamine, sodium salt:PTX at 95:2:1:2. Comparable doses of lipo‑PTX and Taxol were bioequivalent in terms of therapeutic efficacy in xenograft tumor models. However, the systemic side effects, including hematopoietic toxicity, acute hypersensitivity reactions and cardiac irregularities, were significantly reduced in lipo‑PTX‑treated mice compared with those infused with reference formulations of PTX. In conclusion, the present study reported that lipo‑PTX exhibited a higher therapeutic index than clinical PTX formulations.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-edematogenic activity of X. americana L. (HEXA) hydroethanolic extract in ear edema models (acute and chronic) induced by croton oil and by different phlogistic agents (arachidonic acid, capsaicin, phenol and histamine), identifying the possible anti-edematogenic mechanism. HEXA demonstrated a significant anti-edematogenic effect at concentrations of 100-500 mug/ear in ear edema induced by croton oil with higher inhibition of edema of 39.37. However, the concentrations of 100 and 200 mug/ear were taken as a standard, demonstrating the effect in the chronic model induced by croton oil with inhibition of 61.62% and 48.74%. In the AA-induced ear edema model, HEXA showed inhibition of: 24.45% and 32.31%; capsaicin inhibition of 72.72% and 47.57%; phenol inhibition of 34% and 20.1%; and histamine inhibition of 31.8% and 21.62%.

30786188	Irinotecan	Diarrhea	1	1	0	0	0.0	Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy in Refractory Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Standard chemotherapy is associated with low response rates and short progression-free survival among patients with pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines a humanized monoclonal antibody, which targets the human trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop-2), with SN-38, which is conjugated to the antibody by a cleavable linker. Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy enables delivery of high concentrations of SN-38 to tumors. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1/2 single-group, multicenter trial involving patients with advanced epithelial cancers who received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. A total of 108 patients received sacituzumab govitecan-hziy at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight after receiving at least two previous anticancer therapies for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The end points included safety; the objective response rate (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), which was assessed locally; the duration of response; the clinical benefit rate (defined as a complete or partial response or stable disease for at least 6 months); progression-free survival; and overall survival. Post hoc analyses determined the response rate and duration, which were assessed by blinded independent central review. RESULTS: The 108 patients with triple-negative breast cancer had received a median of 3 previous therapies (range, 2 to 10). Four deaths occurred during treatment; 3 patients (2.8%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (in >/=10% of the patients) included anemia and neutropenia; 10 patients (9.3%) had febrile neutropenia. The response rate (3 complete and 33 partial responses) was 33.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.6 to 43.1), and the median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 10.8); as assessed by independent central review, these values were 34.3% and 9.1 months, respectively. The clinical benefit rate was 45.4%. Median progression-free survival was 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.1 to 6.3), and overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.2 to 13.7). CONCLUSIONS: Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy was associated with durable objective responses in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Myelotoxic effects were the main adverse reactions. (Funded by Immunomedics; IMMU-132-01 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01631552.).

30376593	Chlormethiazole	Disorders of Excessive Somnolence	0	0	0	0		Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists for acute stroke.	BACKGROUND: Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of GABA receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy and safety of GABA receptor agonists in the treatment of acute stroke. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (accessed May 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2018, Issue 4 (accessed May 2018), MEDLINE (from 1949 to May 2018), Embase (from 1980 to May 2018), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2018), AMED (from 1985 to May 2018), and 11 Chinese databases (accessed May 2018). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials we searched ongoing trial registers, reference lists, and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating GABA receptor agonists versus placebo for people with acute stroke (within 12 hours after stroke onset), with the primary outcomes of efficacy and safety. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted eligible data, cross-checked the data for accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (TACS). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review provides moderate-quality evidence that fails to support the use of GABA receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well-designed RCTs with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.

RATIONALE: Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome and is a rare complication in patients with acute leukemia. PATIENT'S CONCERNS: A 20-year-old male was admitted to our hospital due to skin ecchymosis in his trunk and lower limbs for 10 days. DIAGNOSES: Based on the precise diagnosis of leukemia, namely cell morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biological typing (MICM), the patient was diagnosed with acute T-lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL). INTERVENTIONS: The patient received hyper-Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine,Adriamycin, Dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) regimen chemotherapy (methotrexate, pirarubicin, vincristine and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine) for 3 courses of chemotherapy. After 3 months of treatment, the patient developed intermittent pain, blurred vision, and inarticulate speech. Therefore, the patient was considered as central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) and immediately received 2 courses of chemotherapy with hyper-CVAD-B combined with polyethylene glycol conjugated asparaginase (PEG-ASP). OUTCOMES: On the seventh day after the completion of chemotherapy, the patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis because he complained of perianal pain and hematuria, and his creatine kinase (CK) increased suddenly to 3136 U/L. Finally, the patient died despite all kinds of active rescue. LESSONS: Rhabdomyolysis may occur after chemotherapy of leukemia. When patients developed hematuria, muscle weakness, or even asymptomatic elevation of CK levels, physicians should pay attention to the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis and take active hydration treatment.

Therefore, the patient was considered as central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) and immediately received 2 courses of chemotherapy with hyper-CVAD-B combined with polyethylene glycol conjugated asparaginase (PEG-ASP). OUTCOMES: On the seventh day after the completion of chemotherapy, the patient was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis because he complained of perianal pain and hematuria, and his creatine kinase (CK) increased suddenly to 3136 U/L. Finally, the patient died despite all kinds of active rescue. LESSONS: Rhabdomyolysis may occur after chemotherapy of leukemia. When patients developed hematuria, muscle weakness, or even asymptomatic elevation of CK levels, physicians should pay attention to the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis and take active hydration treatment.

30028446	Capecitabine	Thrombocytopenia	0	0	0	0		Safety and Feasibility of Integrating Yttrium-90 Radioembolization With Capecitabine-Temozolomide for Grade 2 Liver-Dominant Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.	OBJECTIVES: An integrated protocol combining capecitibine-temozolomide with yttrium-90 radioembolization (CapTemY90) for liver-dominant grade 2 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) was designed in the hope of achieving synergistic improvement in liver disease control with no more than additive toxicities. This report describes the feasibility and safety of this regimen. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with unresectable grade 2 NET liver-dominant metastases without contraindications to radioembolization or to CapTem initiated therapy with capecitabine 600 mg/m twice daily for 14 days and temozolomide 150 to 200 mg/m in 2 divided doses on days 10 to 14, with 14 days between cycles. During the first cycle, simulation angiography was performed. The dominant lobe was radioembolized on day 7 of the second cycle. In patients with bilobar disease, the other lobe was treated on day 7 of the third or fourth cycle. RESULTS: Nineteen of 21 patients completed the protocol. Adverse events were as expected. Objective response rate was 74% in the liver and 55% for extrahepatic tumor. Median progression-free survival was not reached. Progression-free survival at 3 years was 67%, with 74% progression-free in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: CapTemY90 is feasible and safe for grade 2 NETs. Toxicities were additive. Oncologic outcomes suggest synergy.

After treatment with infliximab, she developed a fulminant liver failure. Under supportive therapy and steroid medication, recovery of symptoms and transaminases occurred. A few case reports about hepatic side effects of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease have been published. These side effects ranged from asymptomatic increase of transaminases to fulminant liver failure necessitating transplantation. The pathomechanism is not fully understood; in some case reports autoimmune phenomena have been described.
29231783	Cyclophosphamide	Fatigue	1	0	0	0		Dexamethasone exacerbates cytotoxic chemotherapy induced lethargy and weight loss in female tumor free mice.	Cytotoxic chemotherapy can induce a systemic inflammatory response which has been proposed to be an underlying mechanism of cancer treatment related fatigue. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid that has potent anti-inflammatory effects, is incorporated into chemotherapy regimens to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The purpose of this study was to determine whether by suppressing cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced inflammation, dexamethasone could ameliorate chemotherapy induced fatigue/lethargy in tumor free mice. The effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on Cytoxan-Adriamycin (CA)-induced inflammation was assessed by measuring circulating levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, GCSF, KC, and MCP-1 twenty-four-hours post CA injection. Decline in voluntary wheel running activity (VWRA) from baseline (used as a proxy for fatigue/lethargy), body weight and composition, and food intake were monitored in mice administered four cycles of CA every two weeks with or without DEX. CA increased circulating levels of IL-6, GCSF, KC, and MCP-1 and caused a rapid decline in VWRA and body weight immediately following CA-injection. Although the acute CA-induced decline in VWRA and body weight was not evident in mice administered CA + DEX, DEX alone had a suppressive effect on VWRA, and body weight continued to decline in mice administered both CA and DEX while it returned to baseline in CA-treated mice. CA or DEX alone had no long term impact on VWRA but DEX exacerbated lethargy and weight loss in CA-treated mice. Despite dampening the systemic inflammatory response to chemotherapy, dexamethasone failed to ameliorate acute or long term chemotherapy related fatigue/lethargy. Our pre-clinical findings suggest that supportive therapies like dexamethasone used to acutely control nausea and vomiting in cancer patients may actually contribute to overall symptom burden in cancer patients.

"OBJECTIVES: The safety of oral propranolol for infantile hemangioma has not yet been studied at population level since the pediatric use marketing authorization was obtained in Europe. METHODS: A survey of a nationwide, claim-based observational cohort of children <3 years old, with at least 1 delivery of oral propranolol between July 2014 and June 2016, was performed by using the database of the French National Health Insurance system. Standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) were calculated by using, from the same database, a representative random sample of nonexposed subjects. The main outcomes were hospitalizations for cardiovascular (conduction disorders, bradycardia, and hypotension), respiratory (bronchial hyperactivity and bronchospasm), or metabolic events (hypoglycemia and hyperkalaemia), identified through the hospitalization diagnostic codes of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. The main analysis was conducted separately on ""healthy"" children (N = 1484), that is, free from of any prespecified underlying disease and on children with 1 of these underlying diseases (N = 269). RESULTS: In all, 1753 patients <3 years of age had at least 2 deliveries of oral propranolol. In the healthy population, we observed 2 cardiovascular events (SMR = 2.8 [0-6.7]), 51 respiratory events (SMR = 1.7 [1.2-2.1]), and 3 metabolic events (SMR = 5.1 [0-10.9]). In the population with an underlying disease (mainly congenital heart disease), we observed 11 cardiovascular events leading to an SMR of 6.0 (2.5-9.6). SMRs were not significantly raised for respiratory or metabolic events in this ""nonhealthy"" population. CONCLUSIONS: In this study on a large continuous nationwide claims database, we confirm the safety profile of oral propranolol in healthy children to be good."

29029049	Remifentanil	Hyperalgesia	0	1	0	0		Intraoperative naloxone reduces remifentanil-induced postoperative hyperalgesia but not pain: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Intraoperative use of a high-dose remifentanil may induce postoperative hyperalgesia. Low-dose naloxone can selectively reverse some adverse effects of opioids without compromising analgesia. We thus hypothesized that the intraoperative use of a high-dose remifentanil combined with a low-dose naloxone infusion reduces postoperative hyperalgesia compared with the use of remifentanil alone. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective thyroid surgery were randomly assigned into one of three groups, depending on the intraoperative effect-site concentration of remifentanil, with or without a continuous infusion of naloxone: 4 ng ml-1 remifentanil with 0.05 mug kg-1 h-1 naloxone in the high-remifentanil with naloxone group, and 4 or 1 ng ml-1 remifentanil with a placebo in the high- or low-remifentanil groups, respectively. We measured the pain thresholds (primary outcome) to mechanical stimuli using von Frey filaments and incidence of hyperalgesia on the peri-incisional area 24 h after surgery. We also measured pain intensity, analgesic consumptions and adverse events up to 48 h after surgery. RESULTS: The pain threshold presented as von Frey numbers [median (interquartile range)] was significantly lower in the high-remifentanil group (n=31) than in the high-remifentanil with naloxone (n=30) and the low-remifentanil (n=30) groups [3.63 (3.22-3.84) vs 3.84 (3.76-4.00) vs 3.80 (3.69-4.08), P=0.011]. The incidence of hyperalgesia was also higher in the high-remifentanil group than in the other groups [21/31 vs 10/30 vs 9/30, P=0.005]. Postoperative pain intensity, analgesic consumptions and adverse events were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative use of low-dose naloxone combined with high-dose remifentanil reduced postoperative hyperalgesia but not pain. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02856087.
30268094	Ibuprofen	Cholestasis	1	1	1	1	1.0	Vanishing bile duct syndrome with hyperlipidemia after ibuprofen therapy in an adult patient: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently prescribed drugs and can cause drug-induced liver injury. Although patients with drug-induced liver injury from NSAIDs often recover spontaneously, 3% of them required hospitalization and those with persistent cholestasis present a diagnostic challenge. Recently, a few cases of children with persistent jaundice reported have been linked to the vanishing bile duct syndrome. However, data on adult patients is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report herein a case of an adult patient who had persistent cholestasis with hyperlipidemia from the VBDS after ibuprofen use. We described a female patient with severe jaundice after taking ibuprofen, although she had no history of liver disease before. The drug-induced liver injury from ibuprofen was identified by clinical features and liver biopsy, which included the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method scores of 6 and pathological features of cholestasis with stage four drug-induced injury as well as loss of bile duct structures. The clinical course was featuring with persistently high levels of bilirubin associated with hyperlipidemia over the period of one month, although the laboratory abnormalities were slightly improved spontaneously after the cessation of ibuprofen. Her autoantibodies markers including AMA-M2 ASMA, RO-52, LKM, SLA, and anti-glycoprotein-210 were negative. The second liver biopsy was performed on day 213 due to persistent hyperbilirubinemia. Pathological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of vanishing bile duct syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: A rare case of ibuprofen-associated vanishing bile duct syndrome in an adult female patient is presented. Clinicians need to be aware of vanishing bile duct syndrome as a serious consequence of ibuprofen use in adult patients, although ibuprofen is considered to be among the safest NSAIDs.

29776576	Warfarin	Hemorrhage	0	0	0	0		Safety of apixaban in combination with dronedarone in patients with atrial fibrillation.	BACKGROUND: There have been concerns about bleeding risks for patients with atrial fibrillation treated with dronedarone in combination with new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). The aim of the study was to compare the bleeding risks with the apixaban + dronedarone and warfarin + dronedarone combinations. METHOD: Retrospective study of Swedish nationwide health registers. All patients with atrial fibrillation who used dronedarone in combination with apixaban or warfarin during 2013-2016 were identified. Two propensity matched cohorts of each 1681 patients were compared. The main endpoint included intracranial bleeding, bleedings with hospitalization and fatal bleedings. RESULTS: Bleedings thus defined occurred at rates of 1.31 and 2.14 per 100 years at risk with the apixaban and warfarin combinations respectively (p = 0.121). The hazard ratio with the apixaban combination was 0.66 (CI 0.35-1.23) compared to the warfarin combination. No significant differences were seen regarding secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION: Major bleedings were rare among patients with atrial fibrillation treated with dronedarone in combination with apixaban or warfarin. No significant differences in favour of either drug combination were found.

Older patients with type 2 diabetes are prone to developing adverse events with aggressive antihyperglycaemic therapy. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is one such rare, life-threatening adverse drug effect. We report the case of a 70-year-old man with a glycated haemoglobin of 7.9% who was on a stable, maximally tolerated dose of metformin for managing his type 2 diabetes. He was initiated on liraglutide injections with hopes to achieve better glycaemic control, but developed unrelenting nausea and vomiting during the third week of treatment. He presented to the hospital with these symptoms and was noted to have severe MALA. He sustained an in-hospital cardiac arrest requiring emergent resuscitation along with vasopressor and mechanical ventilator support. He underwent continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration to remove metformin and correct the acidosis, following which he stabilised and supportive therapy was weaned off. He was discharged from the hospital on insulin therapy with incomplete renal recovery.

The combination of cytarabine and an anthracycline has been the standard of care for the induction of remission in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The response to treatment and survival of adult patients with AML are still variable and depend on multiple factors. Therefore, there have been many efforts to improve the response to treatment and survival rates by either increasing the cytarabine dose or adding a third agent to the standard induction chemotherapy regimen. Unfortunately, attempts to improve response and survival have been mostly unsuccessful. Recent clinical trials and retrospective studies explored the addition of cladribine to standard induction chemotherapy for AML. Some of these studies showed higher rates of complete remission, and one showed improved survival. In this review, we will discuss the antileukemic properties of cladribine and summarize the recent clinical data regarding its incorporation into the induction therapy for adult AML.

30083815	Tranylcypromine	Hypertension	1	1	0	0	0.0	Myocardial Injury from Tranylcypromine-Induced Hypertensive Crisis Secondary to Excessive Tyramine Intake.	Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are known to cause hypertensive crisis when combined with intake of tyramine, classically found in cheese. We present a case of MAOI-induced hypertensive crisis leading to significant troponin release after soft cheese intake. A 51-year-old lady presented with left-sided chest pain, palpitations and headache in the context of significant hypertension after eating soft cheese. She had a similar episode 2 month prior to this presentation, which resulted in a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction after a troponin of 2768 ng/L (Ref < 17 ng/L) with normal cardiac investigations and CT pulmonary angiogram. She was known to be on tranylcypromine for bipolar depression. Subsequent cardiac investigations were normal, as were those for phaeochromocytoma and Conn's disease. Tranylcypromine is a non-selective irreversible MAOI used in refractory depression and bipolar disorder. MAOIs are known to cause hypertensive crisis when combined with soft cheese due to unopposed release of catecholamines from reduced tyramine metabolisation, leading to injury and possible myonecrosis. Three previous case reports have demonstrated either creatinine kinase or troponin rise with myocardial infarction due to this hypertensive crisis and our case is the fourth with significant hypertension and cardiac biomarker rise related to MAOI, specifically tranylcypromine.

29500139	Amiodarone	Peripheral Nervous System Diseases	1	0	0	0		Assessing the Risk for Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients Treated With Dronedarone Compared With That in Other Antiarrhythmics.	PURPOSE: There are few data on the risk for peripheral neuropathy associated with dronedarone, a newer antiarrhythmic medicine. The objective of this study was to assess whether dronedarone is potentially associated with an increased risk for peripheral neuropathy compared with other antiarrhythmics, including amiodarone, sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone. METHODS: The MarketScan database was used for identifying patients who were at least 18 years of age, had atrial fibrillation or flutter, and had not been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in the 180-day period prior to or on the date of the first prescription of an antiarrhythmic between July 20, 2009, and December 31, 2011. Peripheral neuropathy that occurred during the treatment period for a study drug was ascertained using ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes. For each antiarrhythmic, the incidence rate of peripheral neuropathy was calculated. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for peripheral neuropathy for dronedarone compared with another antiarrhythmic was obtained, with control for age, sex, diabetes mellitus status, and the presence of other comorbidities. FINDINGS: The study population included 106,933 patients treated with dronedarone (n = 12,989), amiodarone (n = 45,173), sotalol (n = 22,036), flecainide (n = 14,244), or propafenone (n = 12,491). The incidence rates (per 1000 person-years) of peripheral neuropathy were 1.33 for dronedarone, 2.38 for amiodarone, 1.20 for sotalol, 1.08 for flecainide, and 1.97 for propafenone. The aHRs for peripheral neuropathy for dronedarone relative to other drugs ranged from 0.53 (95% CI, 0.21-1.34) compared with propafenone, to 0.94 (95% CI, 0.38-2.30) compared with sotalol. A new-user analysis showed similar results. IMPLICATIONS: The risks for peripheral neuropathy were not significantly different between dronedarone and other antiarrhythmics.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the modulatory effect of S-allyl cysteine against cyclophosphamide-induced changes in uroplakin IIIa, CCL11 and TNF-alpha. METHODS: Mice were treated with cyclophosphamide (200mg/kgx7 d, ip). S-allyl cysteine (150mg/kgx7d, ip), and comparator compound mesna (40mg/kgx7d, ip) were administered 1h before and 4h after each cyclophosphamide dose. The urinary bladder was analysed for mRNA and protein changes in uroplakin IIIa (UPIIIa), CCL11 and TNF-alpha and histopathological findings. RESULTS: Cyclophosphamide caused hemorrhagic cystitis formation and downregulation of UPIIIa. These changes were accompanied by upregulation of CCL11 and TNF-alpha. S-allyl cysteine attenuated these changes including protection at histological level. Mesna which was used as a comparator drug also showed protection. However, relatively S-allyl cysteine showed a stronger protective effect than mesna. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight a correlation between downregulaion of UPIIIa and enhanced production of inflammatory biomarkers and protective effects of S-allyl cysteine which has been reported to be a potent uroprotective agent. The present study strengthens its role which could be clinically exploited in chemotherapy regimen.
29795058	Bupropion	Serotonin Syndrome	1	1	0	0	0.0	Delayed Serotonin Syndrome in the Setting of a Mixed Fluoxetine and Serotonin Antagonist Overdose.	BACKGROUND Serotonin syndrome is a condition characterized predominantly by neuromuscular symptoms and altered thermoregulation in response to serotonergic overtone. Treatment is focused on withdrawal of serotonergic agents, which leads to resolution in the majority of cases. In the setting of serotonergic overdose, the onset of serotonin syndrome is usually within 4 to 13 h. Here, we report a case of delayed-onset serotonin syndrome in a patient who ingested a mixture of longer-acting serotonin agonists with serotonin antagonists. CASE REPORT A 24-year-old male was transferred to our medical intensive care unit with hypotension and altered mental status after an overdose of fluoxetine, cyproheptadine, trazodone, olanzapine, risperidone, and bupropion. After approximately 72 h, the patient developed symptoms of fever, lower leg clonus, hyperreflexia, and agitation. He was diagnosed with delayed-onset serotonin syndrome, which responded well to re-administration of cyproheptadine, leading to resolution of symptoms by day 5 of his stay. CONCLUSIONS In this present case, our patient presented with the longest reported delay in the onset of serotonin syndrome after intentional ingestion. This was likely secondary to co-ingestion of long-acting serotonin agonists with protective shorter-acting serotonin antagonists (cyproheptadine and olanzapine). Clinicians should consider delayed-onset serotonin syndrome when patients ingest longer-acting serotonergic agents with serotonin antagonists.

29901567	Bupropion	Basal Ganglia Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Association of Antidepressant Use With Drug-Related Extrapyramidal Symptoms: A Pharmacoepidemiological Study.	BACKGROUND: Antidepressants are one of the most prescribed classes of medications. A number of case reports have linked these drugs to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs), but no large epidemiologic study to date has examined this association. We sought to quantify the association of EPSs with different antidepressants by undertaking a large pharmacoepidemiologic study. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted using a large health claims database in the United States from June 2006 to December 2015. Subjects with a diagnosis of primary Parkinson disease and those who received prescriptions of levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, domperidone, metoclopramide, entacapone, benztropine, selegiline, rasagiline, diphenhydramine, trihexyphenidyl, typical and atypical antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants were excluded. Cases were followed to the first billing code for an extrapyramidal event or last date of enrollment in the cohort. For each case, 10 control subjects were matched by follow-up time, calendar time, and age through density-based sampling. Rate ratios were computed using conditional logistic regression adjusting for other covariates. RESULTS: We identified 3,838 subjects with EPSs compared with 38,380 age-matched control subjects. Rate ratios with respect to EPSs were as follows: duloxetine, 5.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.29-7.53); mirtazapine, 3.78 (95% CI, 1.71-8.32); citalopram, 3.47 (95% CI, 2.68-4.50); escitalopram, 3.23 (95% CI, 2.44-4.26); paroxetine, 3.07 (95% CI, 2.15-4.40); sertraline, 2.57 (95% CI, 2.02-3.28); venlafaxine, 2.37 (95% CI, 1.71-3.29); bupropion, 2.31 (95% CI, 1.67-3.21); and fluoxetine, 2.03 (95% CI, 1.48-2.78). CONCLUSIONS: This observational study demonstrates a harmful association between the incidence of Parkinson disease or associated EPSs and use of the antidepressants duloxetine, mirtazapine, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, bupropion, and fluoxetine.

BACKGROUND: Antidepressants are one of the most prescribed classes of medications. A number of case reports have linked these drugs to extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs), but no large epidemiologic study to date has examined this association. We sought to quantify the association of EPSs with different antidepressants by undertaking a large pharmacoepidemiologic study. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted using a large health claims database in the United States from June 2006 to December 2015. Subjects with a diagnosis of primary Parkinson disease and those who received prescriptions of levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, domperidone, metoclopramide, entacapone, benztropine, selegiline, rasagiline, diphenhydramine, trihexyphenidyl, typical and atypical antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants were excluded. Cases were followed to the first billing code for an extrapyramidal event or last date of enrollment in the cohort. For each case, 10 control subjects were matched by follow-up time, calendar time, and age through density-based sampling. Rate ratios were computed using conditional logistic regression adjusting for other covariates. RESULTS: We identified 3,838 subjects with EPSs compared with 38,380 age-matched control subjects.

29164296	Oxaliplatin	Hyperalgesia	0	1	0	0		Pharmacokinetic and toxicodynamic evaluation of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy and hematological toxicity in rats.	PURPOSE: Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a third-generation, platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent and is widely used in gastroenterological cancer regimens. It is important to complete chemotherapy cycles to improve treatment efficacy for cancer patients. However, undesirable side effects, including acute and chronic neuropathies, and myelosuppression, lead to the discontinuation of chemotherapy in some treatment regimens. To predict and prevent the onset of side effects, and to establish appropriate dose adjustment, pharmacokinetic and toxicodynamic studies were performed to investigate the effects of L-OHP in rats. METHODS: Rats were administered intravenous L-OHP, once a week for 4 weeks, at doses of 3, 5, or 8 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic profiles were observed on Day 1 and Day 22. Acute and chronic neuropathies were evaluated over 4 weeks; cold allodynia was evaluated using an acetone test and mechanical allodynia using the von Frey test. Hematological parameters were also investigated during the same period. RESULTS: The mean AUC0-infinity values for L-OHP were 0.4 +/- 0.2, 2.4 +/- 0.4, and 3.5 +/- 0.9 ng h/mL, increasing dose-dependently on Day 1. The accumulation of L-OHP on Day 22 was observed after repeated administration of L-OHP, as shown by mean AUC0-infinity values of 0.6 +/- 0.2, 4.0 +/- 1.0, and 14.1 +/- 9.8 ng.h/mL, for the three doses. Cold allodynia was observed from Day 3 in the 5 and 8 mg/kg groups, and the extent of this response was dose-dependent. Mechanical allodynia was also observed from Day 10 in the 5 and 8 mg/kg groups. Moreover, the platelet count was the most sensitive among the hematological parameters. CONCLUSION: These results provide useful experimental data for clinical cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, to establish a pharmacokinetic and toxicodynamic model of L-OHP for adequate dose adjustment.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of new-onset depression in a cohort of US adult patients initiating lipophilic statin therapy compared to hydrophilic statin therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Large US commercial claims database PARTICIPANTS: 1:1 propensity score matched cohort of lipophilic (atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin) and hydrophilic (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) statin initiators between January 2009 to June 2015. OUTCOME: New onset of depression. RESULTS: In a propensity-score matched cohort of 299,298 statin initiators, the crude incidence of depression in the hydrophilic and lipophilic group was 136.6 and 142.8 per 10,000 person-years respectively. Compared to hydrophilic statin use, lipophilic statin use was not associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of depression, adjusted HR 1.05 (95% CI, 1.00-1.10, p = 0.078) and excess incidence of 6.3 (95% CI, -0.7-13.7) per 10,000 person-years. Findings were consistent across the subgroups of patients with history of psychiatric conditions HR 1.05 (95% CI, 0.94-1.16, p = 0.41), and those initiating statins for primary or secondary prevention, HR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.97-1.10, p = 0.33) and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.99-1.16, p = 0.10) respectively. Within individual lipophilic statins, only simvastatin was associated with a moderate increase in the risk of depression HR 1.09 (95% CI, 1.02-1.16, p = 0.003), followed by lovastatin HR 1.07 (95% CI, 0.93-1.24, p = 0.34) and atorvastatin HR 1.05 (95% CI, 0.97-1.13, p = 0.27). LIMITATIONS: Findings are generalizable to patients with commercial insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic statin use was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of incident depression.

29465362	Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)	Scleroderma, Systemic	1	1	0	0	0.0	Development of systemic sclerosis in transgender females: a case series and review of the literature.	OBJECTIVES: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic, autoimmune connective tissue disease with a female predominance. The reason for the female predilection in SSc may relate to the difference in hormones between the genders. There are no current data on the influence male-to-female sex transition may have in the development of SSc. We report three patients who developed SSc after initiating the transgender process, and review current literature in regards to transgender patients with connective tissue disease (CTD). METHODS: We describe the clinical features and disease course of three transgender patients who developed SSc after their transition from male-to-female, who presented to our centre. Two additional transgender cases de- scribed in the literature with CTD were included in this review. RESULTS: All three patients developed SSc after having started the hormonal therapy required to transition. Two patients had surgical procedures preceding their diagnosis of SSc. Antibody profile, time of onset and disease features differed among our patients. Hormonal therapies were continued in all patients and they received the standard therapy for SSc. One patient died from complications of her disease. Only two cases describing the development of CTD in transgender patients were identified in the literature and both of these patients were diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CONCLUSIONS: This case series suggests that the hormonal modification as part of gender transition may be relevant in development of SSc. No further conclusions can be drawn on the continuation or not of HT.
29641494	Fructose	Hypertension	1	1	0	0	0.0	Maternal Melatonin Therapy Attenuated Maternal High-Fructose Combined with Post-Weaning High-Salt Diets-Induced Hypertension in Adult Male Rat Offspring.	Consumption of food high in fructose and salt is associated with the epidemic of hypertension. Hypertension can originate from early life. Melatonin, a pleiotropic hormone, regulates blood pressure. We examined whether maternal melatonin therapy can prevent maternal high-fructose combined with post-weaning high-salt diet-induced programmed hypertension in adult offspring. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received either a normal diet (ND) or a 60% fructose diet (HF) during pregnancy and the lactation period. Male offspring were on either the ND or a high-salt diet (HS, 1% NaCl) from weaning to 12 weeks of age and were assigned to five groups (n = 8/group): ND/ND, HF/ND, ND/HS, HF/HS, and HF/HS+melatonin. Melatonin (0.01% in drinking water) was administered during pregnancy and lactation. We observed that maternal HF combined with post-weaning HS diets induced hypertension in male adult offspring, which was attenuated by maternal melatonin therapy. The beneficial effects of maternal melatonin therapy on HF/HS-induced hypertension related to regulating several nutrient-sensing signals, including Sirt1, Sirt4, Prkaa2, Prkab2, Pparg, and Ppargc1a. Additionally, melatonin increased protein levels of mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR), decreased plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine levels, and increased the l-arginine-to-ADMA ratio. The reprogramming effects by which maternal melatonin therapy protects against hypertension of developmental origin awaits further elucidation.

The beneficial effects of maternal melatonin therapy on HF/HS-induced hypertension related to regulating several nutrient-sensing signals, including Sirt1, Sirt4, Prkaa2, Prkab2, Pparg, and Ppargc1a. Additionally, melatonin increased protein levels of mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR), decreased plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine levels, and increased the l-arginine-to-ADMA ratio. The reprogramming effects by which maternal melatonin therapy protects against hypertension of developmental origin awaits further elucidation.
29537058	Lacosamide	Atrioventricular Block	1	1	0	0	0.0	[Lacosamide associated with high-degree block in a patient with trigeminal neuralgia].	INTRODUCTION: Lacosamide is an antiepileptic drug whose exact mechanism of action remains unknown. It acts by increasing the slow inactivation of the voltage-dependent sodium channels of the cell membranes. It is indicated in the treatment of focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation and is occasionally used as adjunct treatment in neuropathic pain. Although the most frequent side effects are mild (dizziness, diplopia, blurred vision, headache, tremor, etc.), others such as supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, changes in repolarisation, atrioventricular blocks and even cardiac arrest or sudden death have been reported. CASE REPORT: A 74-year-old male, diagnosed with classic trigeminal neuralgia treated with 200 mg/12 h of carbamazepine, who visited due to a worsening of the pain in the trigeminal V1-V2 region. On the sixth day after admission, after adjusting the carbamazepine treatment to a descending regime, 400 mg/24 h of eslicarbazepine and 100 mg/12 h of intravenous lacosamide, he presented a complete atrioventricular block with extreme bradycardia that required the placement of a pacemaker. CONCLUSIONS: Voltage-dependent sodium channel blockade mainly affects non-sinusal cardiac tissue. An alteration in the atrioventricular or infrahisian node is more consistent with its mechanism of action. Other cases of atrioventricular block in this kind of polytherapy have been reported. Precaution is advised in the concomitant use of antiepileptic drugs, above all among those that prolong the PR interval, and they should be contraindicated in patients with a history of atrioventricular block, ischaemic heart disease or heart failure. Before starting, a baseline electrocardiogram and regular electrocardiographic monitoring are advised during the first few weeks.
30055204	Clomiphene	Melanoma	0	1	0	0		Melanoma risk after in vitro fertilization: A review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: The role of female sex hormones in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma (MM) remains controversial. Although melanocytes appear to be hormonally responsive, the effect of estrogen on MM cells is less clear. Available clinical data does not consistently demonstrate that increased endogenous hormones from pregnancy or increased exogenous hormones from oral contraceptive pills and hormone replacement affect MM prevalence and outcome. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine potential associations between in vitro fertilization (IVF) and melanoma. METHODS: A literature review was conducted. Primary outcomes were reported as associations between IVF and melanoma risk compared with the general population. Secondary outcomes included associations stratified by type of IVF regimen and subgroup, such as parous versus nulliparous patients. RESULTS: Eleven studies met our inclusion criteria. Five studies found no increased risk for MM among IVF users compared with the general population. Two studies found an increase in MM in clomiphene users, and 4 studies found an increase in MM among patients who were gravid or parous either before or after IVF. CONCLUSION: The reviewed studies do not reveal consistent patterns of association between IVF and MM among all infertile women. However, the data indicates a potential increased risk for MM in ever-parous patients treated with IVF. High-quality studies including a large number of MM cases that control for well-established MM risk factors are needed to adequately assess the relationship between IVF and MM, particularly among ever-parous women.

29848361	Febuxostat	Cardiovascular Diseases	0	0	0	0		Efficacy and safety of febuxostat extended release and immediate release in patients with gout and moderate renal impairment: phase II placebo-controlled study.	BACKGROUND: Febuxostat immediate release (IR), a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated for the management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout by lowering urate levels. An extended release (XR) formulation of febuxostat was developed to provide equal or superior efficacy on urate lowering compared with the IR formulation and potentially lower the risk of treatment-initiated gout flares due to an altered pattern of drug exposure. The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of febuxostat XR and IR formulations in patients with gout and moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtrate rate >/= 30 and < 60 ml/min). METHODS: This was an exploratory, 3-month, phase II, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind proof-of-concept study. Patients (n = 189) were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive placebo or febuxostat IR 40 mg, XR 40 mg, IR 80 mg, or XR 80 mg once daily. Endpoints included: proportion of patients with serum uric acid (sUA) < 5.0 mg/dl at month 3 (primary endpoint), proportion of patients with sUA < 6.0 mg/dl at month 3, and proportion of patients with >/= 1 gout flare requiring treatment over 3 months. RESULTS: At month 3, all febuxostat treatment groups were associated with greater proportions of patients achieving sUA < 5.0 mg/dl (p < 0.05 vs placebo). A greater proportion of patients receiving XR 40 mg achieved sUA < 5.0 mg/dl versus those receiving IR 40 mg (p = 0.034); proportions were similar in the IR 80 mg and XR 80 mg groups. Higher proportions of febuxostat-treated patients achieved sUA < 6.0 mg/dl at month 3 (p < 0.05 vs placebo) and experienced >/= 1 gout flare (significant for all comparisons, except XR 40 mg). Incidences of treatment-related adverse events were low across all treatment groups; the majority were mild or moderate with no apparent trends correlating with IR or XR doses. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was hypertension. One death (unrelated to the study drug) was reported. CONCLUSIONS: These exploratory data demonstrate that febuxostat (XR and IR) formulations were effective and well tolerated in patients with gout and moderate renal impairment.

29063980	Topiramate	Glaucoma, Angle-Closure	1	1	1	1	0.0	Bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma and myopic shift by topiramate-induced ciliochoroidal effusion: case report and literature review.	PURPOSE: To report two cases of ciliochoroidal effusion after the usage of topiramate. CASES: Two middle-aged women experienced sudden onset of acute glaucoma and acquired myopia after taking topiramate. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated bilateral ciliochoroidal effusion and angle closure. The A-scan ultrasonography revealed shallow anterior chamber and thick lens. After the treatment and drug withdrawal, intraocular pressure, refractive status and angle anatomy returned to normal and there was resolution of ciliochoroidal effusion. During the clinical course, the anterior chamber depth (ACD) increased from 2.02 to 3.30 mm (1.28 mm of changes) OD and from 1.94 to 3.36 mm (1.42 mm of changes) OS. The lens thickness (LT) became thinner from 4.53 to 4.31 mm (0.22 mm of changes) OD and from 4.59 to 4.30 mm (0.29 mm of changes) OS in the first case. In the second case, the ACD increased from 2.33 to 3.07 mm (0.74 mm of changes) OD and from 2.30 to 3.05 mm (0.75 mm of changes) OS. The LT became thinner from 4.42 to 4.27 mm (0.15 mm of changes) OD and from 4.38 to 4.26 mm (0.12 mm of changes) OS. The forward displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm contributed more to the shallowness of the anterior chamber than the thickening of the lens itself (only accounting for 20%). CONCLUSION: Topiramate-induced bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma and myopic shift was due to ciliochoroidal effusion which resulted in thicker lens and shallow anterior chamber. The later was mainly due to anterior displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm.
29287216	Lacosamide	Dizziness	0	0	0	0		The effectiveness and safety of lacosamide in children with epilepsy in a clinical practice setting.	BACKGROUND: Seizures in up to 30% of children with epilepsy become refractory to treatment, decreasing their quality of life. Studies suggest that lacosamide may be effective in pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. AIMS: To assess the effectiveness and safety of lacosamide in a population of children with mostly focal refractory epilepsy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of children aged <18years presenting to a single hospital in Spain. Data from baseline, and 3, 6, and 12months after lacosamide initiation were collected and analyzed. Response to lacosamide was categorized by seizure frequency (seizure freedom or >/=75%, >/=50%, and <50% reduction in seizures). RESULTS: One hundred ninety-one pediatric patients (~55% male) with focal epilepsy treated with lacosamide were included. The mean age at lacosamide initiation was 9.4years, and the mean duration of epilepsy was 5.4years. Seizure-free rates at 3, 6, and 12months were 9.7%, 11.8%, and 16.0%. At 12months, 44.4% of the population had a >/=50% reduction in seizure frequency. When analyzing response according to the number of previous/concomitant AEDs, those patients who received </=2 previous AEDs/fewer concomitant AEDs had significantly greater response rates than those who received greater numbers of previous/concomitant AEDs; however, no predictive factors for response were identified. The most common adverse events were seizure number increased (14.7%), diplopia (5.2%), dizziness (3.7%), ataxia (2.1%), and drowsiness (2.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Lacosamide use in children with refractory focal epilepsy can result in a reduction in seizure rate that improves progressively over time with few adverse effects, making lacosamide a promising option in these patients.
30083888	Acyclovir	Acute Kidney Injury	1	1	0	0	0.0	Incidence and predictors of intravenous acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity.	To assess the incidence, predictive factors, and prognosis of acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity. We conducted a historical prospective cohort study of patients treated with intravenous acyclovir in North Denmark Region from 2009 to 2016. Information on baseline demographics, co-morbidities, plasma creatinine, and treatment was obtained from the medical records. The primary outcome was an increase of >/= 40 mumol/L in plasma creatinine level from baseline. We included 276 patients treated with intravenous acyclovir of which 29 (10.5%) met the primary outcome. In 14 cases, the treating physician considered acyclovir the main reason for nephrotoxicity, whereas a potential competing cause of renal impairment was present among the 15 remaining patients. Hypertension was the only predictive factor associated with nephrotoxicity (risk ratio (RR), 2.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.41-5.46), while having no co-morbidities was protective (RR, 0.32; CI, 0.16-0.63). In all cases, the nephrotoxicity was reversible following rehydration and dose reduction or discontinuation of the drug. However, the normalized plasma creatinine upon treatment was significantly higher between cases with acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity than cases with a potential competing cause (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 93.5 mumol/L [85-108] vs 75 mumol/L [66.5-88]; p = 0.019). Acyclovir-induced, reversible nephrotoxicity was observed in 5.1-10.5% of patients. It is difficult to predict who will develop acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity; it may occur late in treatment and hypertension was the only independent predictive factor, while the absence of co-morbidities was protective. Ensuring hydration, frequent evaluations of renal function, and corresponding dose adjustment of intravenous acyclovir treatment seem prudent.

28263222	Everolimus	Hyperglycemia	0	1	0	0		mTOR and Cardiovascular Diseases: Diabetes Mellitus.	The mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are potent immunosuppressors used for prevention of acute rejection after transplantation and have been more recently used as anticancer drugs. mTOR inhibitors have a significant impact on glucose metabolism and frequently induce diabetes. mTOR inhibitors, when used as immunosuppressive agents (sirolimus, everolimus), can induce diabetes with an incidence which is low when used without calcineurin inhibitors but high when used in combination with calcineurin inhibitors (from 11.0% to 38.1%). mTOR inhibitors used as anticancer agents (everolimus, temsirolimus) increase significantly the risk for new-onset diabetes and induce a 5-fold increase in the risk for severe hyperglycemia. The deleterious effect of mTOR inhibitors on glucose metabolism is due to an increased insulin resistance secondary to a reduction of the insulin signaling pathway within the cell and a reduction of insulin secretion via a direct effect on the pancreatic beta cells. Because of the risk for diabetes, it is recommended, when starting a treatment with an mTOR inhibitor, to check fasting blood glucose every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment then every month and HbA1c every 3 months and to intensify self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with known diabetes. When fasting blood glucose is more than 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), when plasma glucose is more than 200 mg/dL at any time, or when HbA1c is more than 6.5%, it is recommended to start antidiabetic treatment.

PURPOSE: The aim is discussing the origins of worsening of external eye condition (EEC) and of tear film (TF) instability after wear of silicone-hydrogel contact lenses (CLs) with hydrogen-peroxide (H(2)O(2)) care system. METHODS: EEC and TF stability were evaluated before and after 15days of wear combined with different care systems: (1) H(2)O(2), (2) detergent solution and H(2)O(2), (3) multipurpose solution (MPS), (4) H(2)O(2) and artificial tears. In-vitro cell mortality tests were performed after 24h cell incubation with CLs treated with H(2)O(2). Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) was carried out on tears of non-wearers and CL wearers who used MPS or H(2)O(2) solution. RESULTS: Worsening of EEC was observed only for the group using H(2)O(2) (group 1). In-vitro, cell mortality was found higher for worn CL than for unworn CLs. Worsening of TF stability was observed regardless of care system and also PCS results on tears of CL wearers were found different compared to non-wearers regardless of care system. The only observed remedy for tear instability of CL wearers was found to be the administration of artificial tears. CONCLUSIONS: Worsening of EEC of CL wearers using H(2)O(2) is attributed to H(2)O(2) scarce cleaning efficacy, which can be solved by adding a CL detergent solution. The origin of TF instability is found to be different. A remedy was found to be the administration of artificial tears, whose effect could be attributed either to the role of specific components or to rinsing and replacement of TF during wear.

PURPOSE: Peritoneal metastasis (PM) in advanced or recurrent gastric cancer (AGC) is the most frequent cause of death from this disease. However, current treatments remain unsatisfactory. We previously conducted studies of docetaxel, cisplatin and S-1 (DCS) combination chemotherapy for AGC. The aim of this study was to investigate the benefits and tolerability of DCS in PM patients. METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups: patients without PM (non-PM); PM patients without ascites, or mild to moderate ascites (None-Mod); and PM patients with massive ascites (Massive). Patients received oral S-1 (40 mg/m(2) b.i.d.) on days 1-14, and intravenous cisplatin (60 mg/m(2)) and docetaxel (50-60 mg/m(2)) on day 8 every 3 weeks. Drug exposure, adverse events, tumor response, progression-free and overall survival (OS) rates were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 111 AGC patients who received DCS as first-line therapy, 37 cases had complicated PM, 15 of whom displayed massive ascites. The response rate for PM patients was 81.5%. Drug exposure and toxicities were not meaningfully different among the groups. The MSTs were also similar: 22.6 months for the non-PM, 21.7 months for the None-Mod PM, and 16.8 months for the Massive, respectively. Ten (27.0%) patients with PM achieved downstaging and underwent curative surgery, subsequently demonstrating an excellent MST of 28.0 months. An independent prognostic factor for OS, as revealed by multivariate analyses. was a good performance status. CONCLUSION: DCS is feasible and efficacious for AGC with PM, especially when patients present with a good PS.

METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups: patients without PM (non-PM); PM patients without ascites, or mild to moderate ascites (None-Mod); and PM patients with massive ascites (Massive). Patients received oral S-1 (40 mg/m(2) b.i.d.) on days 1-14, and intravenous cisplatin (60 mg/m(2)) and docetaxel (50-60 mg/m(2)) on day 8 every 3 weeks. Drug exposure, adverse events, tumor response, progression-free and overall survival (OS) rates were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 111 AGC patients who received DCS as first-line therapy, 37 cases had complicated PM, 15 of whom displayed massive ascites. The response rate for PM patients was 81.5%. Drug exposure and toxicities were not meaningfully different among the groups. The MSTs were also similar: 22.6 months for the non-PM, 21.7 months for the None-Mod PM, and 16.8 months for the Massive, respectively. Ten (27.0%) patients with PM achieved downstaging and underwent curative surgery, subsequently demonstrating an excellent MST of 28.0 months. An independent prognostic factor for OS, as revealed by multivariate analyses. was a good performance status. CONCLUSION: DCS is feasible and efficacious for AGC with PM, especially when patients present with a good PS.

28965701	Manganese	Gait Disorders, Neurologic	1	1	0	0	0.0	Environmental exposure to manganese in air: Tremor, motor and cognitive symptom profiles.	BACKGROUND: Excessive exposure to manganese (Mn) may cause parkinsonian-like motor and tremor symptoms and adverse cognitive effects, including problems with executive functioning (EF), resembling those found in later-stage Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies seeking to differentiate PD patients into subgroups with associated cognitive and functional outcomes using motor and tremor symptoms identified tremor-dominant (TD) and non-tremor dominant (NTD) subtypes. It is unclear whether differing patterns of pathophysiology and symptoms exist in Mn neurotoxicity, as they do in PD. METHODS: Residents of East Liverpool (n=83) and Marietta, OH (n=99) exposed to chronic (>10years) environmental Mn through industrial pollution were administered neuropsychological measures and a physician-rated scale of movement-disorder symptoms. Two-step cluster analysis was used to group residents based on tremor symptoms, bradykinesia/rigidity symptoms, gait disturbance, and executive function. Cluster membership was validated using modeled air-Mn exposure and a computerized tremor measure. RESULTS: Elevated tremor and motor symptoms and executive dysfunction were observed, and TD and NTD symptom clusters were identified. Two additional clusters were also identified: Executive Dysfunction and Normal Functioning. The NTD residents, with elevated levels of gait disturbance and other movement disorder symptoms, did not evidence EF impairment, as predicted. Instead, residents with EF impairment formed their own cluster, and were relatively free of movement disorder symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results resemble reports in the PD literature with TD and NTD clusters identified, but executive dysfunction did not cluster with NTD symptoms. PD and Mn exposure likely have differing pathophysiology and developmental courses, and therefore different symptom patterns, even when similar symptoms are present.

29924183	Barium Sulfate	Pneumonia, Aspiration	0	1	0	0		Study on the Correlation between Barium Radiography and Pulmonary Infection rate in the Evaluation of Swallowing Function.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the results respectively obtained from the utilization of 60% barium sulfate suspension and Iohexol as contrast agents for videofluoroscopic swallowing studies and the relationship between the clinical application of the two kinds of contrast agents and the incidence of pneumonia. METHODS: Sixty cases of stroke patients with dysphagia were selected in rehabilitation department of our hospital, and the gender, age, position of the disease, and stroke nature between groups had no significant difference. Among which, 30 patients who were administered 350 mgI/ml Iohexol, and the other 30 patients with 60% barium sulfate suspension as contrast agent. We performed videofluoroscopic swallowing studies with barium 60% versus Iohexol within 1 week after admission and 2 weeks after admission. RESULTS: After 2 weeks in hospital, the aspiration pneumonia incidence of two groups was statistically significant (p<0.05), the pneumonia incidence of Iohexol group was lower than barium sulfate group which might have a impossble relevance with barium aspiration. CONCLUSIONS: During the videofluoroscopic swallowing study of dysphagia after stroke, barium sulfate can enhance the pneumonia incidence, and Iohexol can be widely applied in videofluoroscopic swallowing study.
29764439	Atovaquone	Abortion, Spontaneous	1	1	0	0	0.0	A survey on outcomes of accidental atovaquone-proguanil exposure in pregnancy.	BACKGROUND: Malaria chemoprophylaxis options in pregnancy are limited, and atovaquone-proguanil (AP) is not recommended because of insufficient safety evidence. An anonymous, internet-based survey was disseminated to describe outcomes of pregnancies accidentally exposed to AP. Outcomes of interest included miscarriage (defined as pregnancy loss before 20 weeks), stillbirth (defined as pregnancy loss at or after 20 weeks), preterm birth or live birth prior to 37 weeks, and the presence of congenital anomalies. RESULTS: A total of 487 women responded and reported on 822 pregnancies. Of the 807 pregnancies with information available on exposure and outcomes, 10 (1.2%) had atovaquone-proguanil exposure, all in the first trimester, and all resulted in term births with no birth defects. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an anti-malarial not recommended in pregnancy is likely to occur before the woman knows of her pregnancy. This study adds to the limited evidence of the safety of AP in pregnancy. Further study on use of AP in pregnancy should be a high priority, as an alternative option for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in non-immune travellers is urgently needed.

30372707	Levamisole	Purpura	1	1	0	0	0.0	Levamisole-induced vasculopathy with gastric involvement in a cocaine user.	Reports of levamisole-induced vasculopathy (LIV) secondary to use of levamisole-contaminated cocaine largely have been limited to the skin. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman with painful purpuric lesions affecting the cheeks, nose, ears, arms, and legs of several days' duration. She recently had used crack cocaine. A biopsy of a lesion on the right arm demonstrated leukocytoclastic vasculitis. She also reported abdominal pain and gastric reflux of recent onset but denied any history of gastrointestinal tract disease. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed and demonstrated hemorrhagic erosions of the esophagus and stomach similar in appearance to the cutaneous lesions. Because dermatologists often are the specialists making the diagnosis of LIV, it is important they inform other involved clinicians that the skin may not be the sole repository of vascular insult.

28300138	Hydrocortisone	Anxiety	1	1	0	0	0.0	Reduced DNA methylation and psychopathology following endogenous hypercortisolism - a genome-wide study.	Patients with Cushing's Syndrome (CS) in remission were used as a model to test the hypothesis that long-standing excessive cortisol exposure induces changes in DNA methylation that are associated with persisting neuropsychological consequences. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in 48 women with CS in long-term remission (cases) and 16 controls matched for age, gender and education. The Fatigue impact scale and the comprehensive psychopathological rating scale were used to evaluate fatigue, depression and anxiety. Cases had lower average global DNA methylation than controls (81.2% vs 82.7%; p = 0.002). Four hundred and sixty-one differentially methylated regions, containing 3,246 probes mapping to 337 genes were identified. After adjustment for age and smoking, 731 probes in 236 genes were associated with psychopathology (fatigue, depression and/or anxiety). Twenty-four gene ontology terms were associated with psychopathology; terms related to retinoic acid receptor signalling were the most common (adjusted p = 0.0007). One gene in particular, COL11A2, was associated with fatigue following a false discovery rate correction. Our findings indicate that hypomethylation of FKBP5 and retinoic acid receptor related genes serve a potential mechanistic explanation for long-lasting GC-induced psychopathology.

Everolimus (EVR) can be used with calcineurin inhibitors to reduce the risk of renal dysfunction, with similar immunosuppressive effect. In this study, we compared renal function after heart transplantation (HT) under EVR with cyclosporine (CSA) or tacrolimus (TAC). Between 2004 and 2014, EVR with CSA or TAC was used in 117 HT at the National Taiwan University Hospital. After HT, all patients received corticosteroid, EVR (C0 target 3-8 ng/mL) and CSA (C0 blood level 100-200 ng/mL), or TAC (Co blood level 5-10 ng/mL). Renal function was evaluated before HT, every month after HT for up to 1 year, and then every 3 months for up to 2 years. Blood-drug levels of EVR, CSA, and TAC were also monitored simultaneously with renal function. The estimated mean glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 76.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) before HT. After HT, the eGFR was 64 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at the third month, and 64 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at the end of first year. The difference was significant between pre-HT and post-HT (P = .00) during the first year. No significant differences were noted between the CSA and TAC groups. Careful monitoring of blood-drug level and renal function is crucial after heart transplantation. It is concluded that under close monitoring blood-drug level and renal function, it is possible to reach acceptable postoperative renal function with no difference of renal function between EVR plus CSA and EVR plus TAC.

30290801	Fluticasone	Pneumonia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Concomitant inhaled corticosteroid use and the risk of pneumonia in COPD: a matched-subgroup post hoc analysis of the UPLIFT(R) trial.	BACKGROUND: Use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) increases the risk of pneumonia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the magnitude of risk with different ICS remains unclear. METHODS: A post hoc analysis of the 4-year UPLIFT(R) trial to assess whether pneumonia risk differed by type of ICS (fluticasone propionate [FP], other ICS, or no ICS) in permanent users (defined by use until end of study) or in users at baseline (sensitivity analysis). RESULTS: For the permanent-users analysis, 825 patients receiving FP throughout the trial, 825 patients receiving other ICS and 825 patients not receiving ICS were matched on relevant baseline features 1:1:1. A significantly greater risk of pneumonia was observed for FP versus no ICS: the hazard ratio (HR) for risk of pneumonia was 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00, 1.75; p = 0.046) and the rate ratio (RR) was 1.58 (95% CI 1.05, 2.37; p = 0.028). A greater risk was also found for FP versus other ICS: HR 1.28 (95% CI 0.97, 1.68; p = 0.078) and RR 1.48 (95% CI 1.00, 2.19; p = 0.049). A higher proportion of patients on FP were hospitalized with pneumonia (7.9%) versus other ICS (6.7%) or no ICS (5.9%). Whilst other ICS use was associated with the highest number of fatal pneumonia events, the total number of fatal pneumonia incidents was low. A similar pattern was observed in the sensitivity analyses, which included 4002 patients on different treatments at baseline (FP, other ICS, and no ICS) and considered potential switches during the study. CONCLUSION: The results support existing evidence of an increased pneumonia risk with FP use compared with other ICS and no ICS use in patients with COPD. Healthcare professionals should evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of using ICS when making treatment decisions with their patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Post hoc analysis of UPLIFT(R). ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00144339 . Retrospectively registered September 2, 2005.
29936503	Theophylline	Atrial Fibrillation	1	1	0	0	0.0	Atrial Fibrillation and Shock: Unmasking Theophylline Toxicity.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this report is to describe a case of atrial fibrillation and shock precipitated by deliberate self-poisoning with theophylline. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: An 85-year-old male with severe theophylline intoxication in a suicide attempt was admitted with severe cardiac arrhythmia and shock; despite poor prognosis, he fully recovered gradually after proper diagnosis and treatment. Theophylline is a rather forgotten medication; thus, intoxication is not usually considered among the etiologies of potentially treatable cardiologic emergencies, especially when its use is intentionally concealed. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of identifying a comprehensive medication history using all available sources of information as early as possible in an emergency department presentation.
30212990	Cefotetan	Anaphylaxis	1	1	1	1	1.0	Maternal anaphylactic shock in pregnancy: A case report.	RATIONALE: Anaphylaxis is a very rare event in pregnancy, triggering maternal hypotension leading to intrapartum hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in infant. Furthermore, cesarean sections are performed at a high rate in anaphylactic pregnant women. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old pregnant woman presented with maternal anaphylaxis following prophylactic antibiotic injection for cesarean section. Within a few minutes after initiation of intradermal skin test with cefotetan, the pregnant woman developed generalized itchy rash, chest tightness, and dyspnea. DIAGNOSES: Several minutes after the injection of antibiotics, a diffuse urticarial rash was detected over her face and trunk followed by complaints of chest tightness and dyspnea. She was diagnosed with hypotension and hypoxia. Further, fetal heart tones showed bradycardia. A presumptive diagnosis of anaphylactic reaction induced by cefotetan was made for surgical prophylaxis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was managed for anaphylaxis, via administration of epinephrine, glucocorticoid, and antihistamine. Emergency cesarean section performed under general anesthesia resulted in a favorable perinatal outcome for the fetus. OUTCOMES: Maternal and fetal outcomes were good after prompt treatment for anaphylaxis and emergency cesarean section. LESSONS: This is the first reported case of anaphylaxis following cefotetan administration in pregnancy. Cefotetan, a second-generation cephalosporin, is a commonly prescribed antibiotic used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections. The case demonstrated life-threatening anaphylactic reaction during pregnancy. Even a skin test using antibiotics alone triggered anaphylaxis.
29367168	Estriol	Pain	1	0	0	0		Does vaginal estriol make urodynamic changes in women with overactive bladder syndrome and genitourinary syndrome of menopause?	OBJECTIVES: OAB is a common finding in postmenopausal women. Hypoestrogenism is the root cause of many signs and symptoms of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (vaginal dryness, atrophy, dyspareunia, urinary disorders, etc.). As such the aim of this study was to evaluate the urodynamic effects of ultralowdose estriol vaginal gel formulation to treat women with Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause and Overactive Bladder Syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: This open-labeled, single center, prospective study involved 37 women with OAB recruited in our Urogynecological Unit between January and July 2016. They received estriol 50 mcg/g vaginal gel, one applicator-dose per day for 3 weeks followed by one dose twice a week for 12 weeks. Objective and subjective parameters were evaluated before and after treatment through the urodynamic examination, Overactive Bladder symptom score and Short Form Health Survey-36 questionnaires. RESULTS: Vaginal atrophy symptoms and signs as well as the overactive bladder subjective symptom parameter improved significantly. Urodynamic evaluation showed significant improvement in first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity after estriol usage. Patients who had detrusor overactivity did not show any improvement for this parameter after treatment. The voiding function parameters did not significantly change. Short form-36 showed a better quality of life after treatment especially for the emotional role, as well as mental and general health. CONCLUSIONS: A local ultra-low dose concentration of estriol could be effective in women with vaginal atrophy and Overactive Bladder Syndrome for improving both subjective symptoms and urodynamic parameters of storage function not affecting voiding function.

Urodynamic evaluation showed significant improvement in first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity after estriol usage. Patients who had detrusor overactivity did not show any improvement for this parameter after treatment. The voiding function parameters did not significantly change. Short form-36 showed a better quality of life after treatment especially for the emotional role, as well as mental and general health. CONCLUSIONS: A local ultra-low dose concentration of estriol could be effective in women with vaginal atrophy and Overactive Bladder Syndrome for improving both subjective symptoms and urodynamic parameters of storage function not affecting voiding function.
28476288	Atorvastatin	Muscular Diseases	1	0	0	0		Adverse events associated with unblinded, but not with blinded, statin therapy in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid-Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA): a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial and its non-randomised non-blind extension phase.	BACKGROUND: In blinded randomised controlled trials, statin therapy has been associated with few adverse events (AEs). By contrast, in observational studies, larger increases in many different AEs have been reported than in blinded trials. METHODS: In the Lipid-Lowering Arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, patients aged 40-79 years with hypertension, at least three other cardiovascular risk factors, and fasting total cholesterol concentrations of 6.5 mmol/L or lower, and who were not taking a statin or fibrate, had no history of myocardial infarction, and were not being treated for angina were randomly assigned to atorvastatin 10 mg daily or matching placebo in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled phase. In a subsequent non-randomised non-blind extension phase (initiated because of early termination of the trial because efficacy of atorvastatin was shown), all patients were offered atorvastatin 10 mg daily open label. We classified AEs using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. We blindly adjudicated all reports of four prespecified AEs of interest-muscle-related, erectile dysfunction, sleep disturbance, and cognitive impairment-and analysed all remaining AEs grouped by system organ class. Rates of AEs are given as percentages per annum. RESULTS: The blinded randomised phase was done between February, 1998, and December, 2002; we included 101 80 patients in this analysis (5101 [50%] in the atorvastatin group and 5079 [50%] in the placebo group), with a median follow-up of 3.3 years (IQR 2.7-3.7). The non-blinded non-randomised phase was done between December, 2002, and June, 2005; we included 9899 patients in this analysis (6409 [65%] atorvastatin users and 3490 [35%] non-users), with a median follow-up of 2.3 years (2.2-2.4). During the blinded phase, muscle-related AEs (298 [2.03% per annum] vs 283 [2.00% per annum]; hazard ratio 1.03 [95% CI 0.88-1.21]; p=0.72) and erectile dysfunction (272 [1.86% per annum] vs 302 [2.14% per annum]; 0.88 [0.75-1.04]; p=0.13) were reported at a similar rate by participants randomly assigned to atorvastatin or placebo. The rate of reports of sleep disturbance was significantly lower among participants assigned atorvastatin than assigned placebo (149 [1.00% per annum] vs 210 [1.46% per annum]; 0.69 [0.56-0.85]; p=0.0005). Too few cases of cognitive impairment were reported for a statistically reliable analysis (31 [0.20% per annum] vs 32 [0.22% per annum]; 0.94 [0.57-1.54]; p=0.81). We observed no significant differences in the rates of all other reported AEs, with the exception of an excess of renal and urinary AEs among patients assigned atorvastatin (481 [1.87%] per annum vs 392 [1.51%] per annum; 1.23 [1.08-1.41]; p=0.002). By contrast, during the non-blinded non-randomised phase, muscle-related AEs were reported at a significantly higher rate by participants taking statins than by those who were not (161 [1.26% per annum] vs 124 [1.00% per annum]; 1.41 [1.10-1.79]; p=0.006). We noted no significant differences between statin users and non-users in the rates of other AEs, with the exception of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (992 [8.69% per annum] vs 831 [7.45% per annum]; 1.17 [1.06-1.29]; p=0.001) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (114 [0.88% per annum] vs 80 [0.64% per annum]; 1.40 [1.04-1.88]; p=0.03), which were reported more commonly by statin users than by non-users. INTERPRETATION: These analyses illustrate the so-called nocebo effect, with an excess rate of muscle-related AE reports only when patients and their doctors were aware that statin therapy was being used and not when its use was blinded. These results will help assure both physicians and patients that most AEs associated with statins are not causally related to use of the drug and should help counter the adverse effect on public health of exaggerated claims about statin-related side-effects.

INTRODUCTION: Fingolimod is a disease modifying therapies, which has showed clinical efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in clinical trials with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. AIM: To assess fingolimod effectiveness and safety in patients with RRMS in clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present an interim analysis (July 2015) of MS NEXT, an observational, retrospective and multicenter study. 442 patients were included (mean age: 41 +/- 9 years; median baseline EDSS: 3.0; 70% female; 284 previously treated with first-line disease modifying therapies, 139 with natalizumab and 19 without a previous treatment; mean fingolimod treatment duration: 25 +/- 9 months) treated with fingolimod from November 2011 and with at least 12 months follow-up. 56 neurology-unit Spanish hospitals enrolled patients. Basal clinical and demographic data were recorded. Relapses, EDSS scores and radiological activity were recorded at baseline and annually. Adverse events were also recorded during the follow-up period. RESULTS: After two years of follow-up: annual relapse rates decreased by 76%, the proportion of relapse-free patients was 67%, of disability progression-free patients confirmed at 3 months was 91%, of relapse and disability progression-free patients was 63%, of radiological activity-free patients was 50%, and the proportion of relapse, disability progression and radiological activity-free patients was 35%. Only 3.9% of patients discontinued fingolimod permanently during the first year of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis, most of patients treated with fingolimod in clinical practice had a controlled clinical disease activity, stable disability progression and high persistency.

29948822	Tissue Plasminogen Activator	Intracranial Hemorrhages	0	0	0	0		Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Tenecteplase Bolus in Acute Ischemic Stroke: Results of Two Open-Label, Multicenter Trials.	BACKGROUND: Tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) is a promising third-generation plasminogen activator, because of its greater fibrin specificity and longer half-life than alteplase. There is a paucity of studies on intravenous thrombolysis using TNK-tPA in developing countries. The present study has been undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of TNK-tPA with alteplase. METHODS: Two studies were conducted. Study I was an open-label, randomized study in which two doses of TNK-tPA (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) were compared. Study II was an open-label study in which TNK-tPA 0.2 mg/kg bolus was compared with historical controls. The primary endpoint for study I and study II was an improvement of >/= 8 points or a score of 0 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) [major neurological improvement (MNI)] at 24 h. Secondary endpoints for both studies were neurological improvement as assessed using the NIHSS score, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and the Barthel Index (BI) on days 7, 30 and 90. Minimal disability was defined as an mRS score of 0 or 1 and good functional recovery as a BI score of 50-90. Safety was assessed by the proportion of patients having symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 36 h and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at 48 h after treatment. RESULTS: In study I, 20 patients received 0.1 mg/kg and 30 received 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA. There was no significant difference in MNI at 24 h between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA doses. The patients given 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA had a significantly better 3-month outcome (minimal disability, p = 0.007). There was no sICH in study I. In study II, 62 patients (one lost to follow-up) received 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA. MNI was noted in ten patients (16.4%), 3-month minimal disability was noted in 37 patients (60.7%), and good functional recovery was seen in 33 patients (54.1%). sICH occurred in one patient, and four patients died. Pooled data of patients in study I and study II receiving 0.2 mg/kg TNK-tPA were compared with data from the historical National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial. For comparison, the primary endpoint of the NINDS trial (improvement on NIHSS of >/= 4 points or a score of 0 at 24 h) was taken. The primary endpoint though was not significantly different (58.2% vs. 47%, p = 0.08), but with TNK-tPA, greater neurological improvement, minimal disability (70.3 vs. 39%, p < 0.001) and good functional recovery (36.3 vs. 16%, p < 0.001) was noted at 3 months. There was a lower incidence of sICH (1.1 vs. 6.4%, p = 0.05) and lower 3-month mortality (5.5 vs. 17%, p = 0.01) noted with TNK-tPA compared with alteplase. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous TNK-tPA 0.2 mg/kg administered within 3 hours of symptom onset seems to be well tolerated and effective option in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

29602711	Tenofovir	Renal Insufficiency, Chronic	1	1	0	0	0.0	Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate co-administered with lopinavir/ritonavir is strongly associated with tubular damage and chronic kidney disease.	BACKGROUD: With expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a resource-limited setting, the use of second line ART with ritonavir boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) is increasing. However, little is known regarding the renal safety of tenofovir (TDF) co-administered with LPV/r. METHODS: In total 1382 HIV-infected patients were enrolled and data were recorded twice (October 2014 and 2015) in Vietnam. Tubular dysfunction (TD) was defined as urinary beta 2 microglobulin (beta2MG) > 1000 mug/L at both timepoints or increase in beta2MG by > 2000 mug/L. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was defined as creatinine clearance </=60 ml/min or urinary protein/creatinine ratio >/= 0.15 g/gCre at both timepoints. RESULTS: The patients'mean weight and age were 55.9 kg and 38.4 years, respectively, and 41.5% were female. Additionally, 98.2% were on ART, 76.3% were on TDF (mean exposure duration was 35.4 months), and 22.4% had never TDF exposure. TD and CKD were diagnosed in 13% and 8.3% of all patients, respectively. In multivariate analyses, age (OR = 1.057; 95%CI, 1.034-1.081), being female (OR = 0.377; 95%CI, 0.221-0.645), HBsAg positive (OR = 1.812; 95%CI, 1.134-2.894), HCVAb positive (OR = 1.703; 95%CI, 1.100-2.635), TDF exposure (OR = 9.226; 95%CI, 2.847-29.901) and LPV/r exposure (OR = 5.548; 95%CI, 3.313-9.293) were significantly associated with TD. Moreover, age (OR = 1.093; 95%CI, 1.068-1.119), being female (OR = 0.510; 95%CI, 0.295-0.880), weight (OR = 0.909; 95%CI, 0.879-0.939), hypertension (OR = 3.027; 95%CI, 1.714-5.347), TDF exposure (OR = 1.963; 95%CI, 1.027-3.7 53) and LPV/r exposure (OR = 3.122; 95%CI, 1.710-5.699) were significantly associated with CKD. CONCLUSIONS: TDF and LPV/r exposure were strongly associated with TD and CKD, in addition to their known risks. Therefore, attention to renal safety for patients on second line ART is necessary.
27866006	Finasteride	Stroke	0	0	0	0		The Cardiovascular Safety of Dutasteride.	PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials suggest an increased risk of heart failure with dutasteride, which inhibits both the type 1 and type 2 isoforms of 5alpha-reductase. In contrast, no such association has been suggested for finasteride, which selectively inhibits the type 2 isoform. We investigated the risk of cardiovascular events among patients receiving dutasteride relative to finasteride. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a population based cohort study of Ontario men 66 years old or older who commenced treatment with dutasteride or finasteride between October 1, 2005 and March 31, 2015. For each individual treated with dutasteride, we identified 1 treated with finasteride, matching on a propensity score and calendar quarter of treatment initiation to account for temporal changes in prescribing. The primary outcome was hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary analyses were done to examine acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for differences between groups. RESULTS: We studied 36,311 men who commenced dutasteride and 36,311 treated with finasteride. In the primary analysis, we found no difference in the risk of heart failure among patients receiving dutasteride relative to those receiving finasteride (adjusted HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.08). Similarly, we found no difference in the risk of acute myocardial infarction (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.08) or stroke (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.20). CONCLUSIONS: In this population based cohort study of more than 72,000 older men, dutasteride was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events relative to finasteride.

This trial explored the efficacy of re-induction chemotherapy including bortezomib in paediatric relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Patients were randomized 1:1 to bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2) /dose) administered early or late to a dexamethasone and vincristine backbone. Both groups did not differ regarding peripheral blast count on day 8, the primary endpoint. After cycle 1, 8 of 25 (32%) patients achieved complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, 7 (28%) a partial remission and 10 had treatment failure. Most common grade 3-4 toxicities were febrile neutropenia (31%) and pain (17%). Bortezomib was safely combined with vincristine. Bortezomib rarely penetrated the cerebrospinal fluid.

29764506	Fluorouracil	Heart Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Cardiotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine in Chinese patients: a prospective study.	BACKGROUND: 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine-associated cardiotoxicity ranging from asymptomatic electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities to severe myocardial infarction has been reported in a number of studies, but such cardiotoxicity in Chinese patients with malignant diseases has not been investigated to date. In the present study, we aimed to prospectively evaluate the incidence rates and clinical manifestations of 5-FU- and capecitabine-associated cardiotoxicity in cancer patients recruited from multiple centers in China. METHODS: Among the 527 patients who completed the study, 196 received 5-FU-based chemotherapy and 331 received capecitabine-based chemotherapy as either first-line or adjuvant therapy. Adverse events were reported during the treatment and up to 28 days of follow-up. Outcome measures included ECG, myocardial enzymes, cardiac troponin, brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography. Univariate analysis and logistic regression were performed for subgroup analysis and identification of significant independent variables that are associated with cardiotoxicity of both agents. RESULTS: In total, 161 of 527 patients (30.6%) experienced cardiotoxicity. The incidence rate of cardiotoxicity was 33.8% (112/331) in the capecitabine group, which was significantly higher than the rate of 25% (49/196) in the 5-FU group (P = 0.0042). 110/527 patients (20.9%) suffered arrhythmia, 105/527 (19.9%) developed ischemic changes, while only 20/527 patients (3.8%) presented heart failure and 6/527 patients (1.1%) had myocardial infarction. Pre-existing cardiac disease, hypertension, capecitabine-based chemotherapy and duration of treatment were identified as significant risk factors associated with cardiotoxicity. The odds ratio were 15.7 (prior history of cardiac disease versus no history), 1.86 (capecitabine versus 5-FU), 1.06 (5-8 versus 1-4 chemotherapy cycles) and 1.58 (hypertension versus no hypertension), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiotoxicity induced by fluoropyrimidines in the Chinese population may be underestimated in clinical practice. Close monitoring of patients is recommended, especially for those patients at high risk for cardiotoxicity. Possible risk factors are duration of treatment, capecitabine-based chemotherapy, pre-existing cardiac diseases and hypertension. Trial registration This study was initiated on January 22, 2014 and has been retrospectively registered with the registration number ChiCTR1800015434.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition of distinct inflammatory eruptions associated with checkpoint inhibitors. A better understanding of their severity, therapeutic response, and impact on cancer treatment is needed. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the different rashes associated with immunotherapy referred to our institution's oncodermatology clinic and inpatient consultative service and to evaluate their therapeutic response and impact on immunotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients referred to the oncodermatology clinic or inpatient dermatology service during 2016-2018 at Yale-New Haven Hospital for eruptions that developed during immunotherapy. RESULTS: In total, 98 patients (51 men, 47 women) treated with checkpoint inhibitors developed 103 inflammatory eruptions, with a range of mean latency of 0.2-17.7 months. A minority of patients (25/103; 24.3%) required immunotherapy interruption; most of these cases involved immunobullous (7/8; 87.5%), lichenoid (8/26; 30.8%), maculopapular (6/18; 33.3%), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome-like (2/2, 100%) reactions. Only 3 of 16 (18.8%) patients who had their immunotherapy interrupted had a grade 2 or 3 flare on rechallenge. Most reactions (93/103; 90.3%) responded to dermatologic therapy or immunotherapy interruption. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study from a single tertiary care center. CONCLUSION: A variety of inflammatory reactions might occur from immunotherapy with differing degrees of severity. While most rashes responded to topical treatment, immunobullous and exfoliative presentations frequently interrupted immunotherapy. Increased awareness and early recognition could reduce the need for unnecessary immunotherapy interruption.

29576108	Buprenorphine	Dizziness	0	0	0	0		Efficacy and adverse effects of buprenorphine in acute pain management: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.	Buprenorphine appears to have a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, but not analgesia in healthy young patients. However, the efficacy and side-effects of buprenorphine in the setting of acute pain are poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to characterize the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of buprenorphine compared with morphine in the acute pain setting. A systematic review of five databases was performed. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing buprenorphine with morphine in acute pain management were included. Studies performed outside of the hospital setting were excluded. The a priori primary outcomes included pain, respiratory depression, and sedation. Secondary outcomes included requirement for rescue analgesia, time to rescue analgesia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hypotension, and pruritus. Twenty-eight RCTs with 2210 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was no difference in pain [visual analogue scale weighted mean difference (WMD)=-0.29; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.62 to 0.03; I(2)=99%; P=0.07], incidence of respiratory depression [odds ratio (OR)=2.07; 95% CI=0.78-5.51; I(2)=30%; P=0.14], or sedation (OR=1.44; 95% CI=0.76-2.74; I(2)=23%; P=0.26). There was only one secondary outcome with an overall significant difference; buprenorphine use was associated with significantly less pruritus (OR=0.31; 95% CI=0.12-0.84; I(2)=6%; P=0.02). Whilst a theoretical ceiling effect may exist with respect to buprenorphine and respiratory depression, in a clinical setting, it can still cause significant adverse effects on respiratory function. However, given that buprenorphine is an equally efficacious analgesic agent, it is a useful alternative opioid because of its ease of administration and reduced incidence of pruritus.

However, given that buprenorphine is an equally efficacious analgesic agent, it is a useful alternative opioid because of its ease of administration and reduced incidence of pruritus.
29576108	Buprenorphine	Pruritus	0	0	0	0		Efficacy and adverse effects of buprenorphine in acute pain management: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.	Buprenorphine appears to have a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, but not analgesia in healthy young patients. However, the efficacy and side-effects of buprenorphine in the setting of acute pain are poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to characterize the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of buprenorphine compared with morphine in the acute pain setting. A systematic review of five databases was performed. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing buprenorphine with morphine in acute pain management were included. Studies performed outside of the hospital setting were excluded. The a priori primary outcomes included pain, respiratory depression, and sedation. Secondary outcomes included requirement for rescue analgesia, time to rescue analgesia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hypotension, and pruritus. Twenty-eight RCTs with 2210 patients met the inclusion criteria. There was no difference in pain [visual analogue scale weighted mean difference (WMD)=-0.29; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.62 to 0.03; I(2)=99%; P=0.07], incidence of respiratory depression [odds ratio (OR)=2.07; 95% CI=0.78-5.51; I(2)=30%; P=0.14], or sedation (OR=1.44; 95% CI=0.76-2.74; I(2)=23%; P=0.26). There was only one secondary outcome with an overall significant difference; buprenorphine use was associated with significantly less pruritus (OR=0.31; 95% CI=0.12-0.84; I(2)=6%; P=0.02).

This post-hoc subanalysis of the LYM-3002 phase 3 study assessed the efficacy and safety of substituting vincristine in rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (R-CHOP; n = 42) for bortezomib (VR-CAP; n = 38) in a subgroup of 80 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients aged <60 years who did not receive stem cell transplantation (SCT) despite medical eligibility. Complete response (CR)/unconfirmed CR (CRu) rates were 67 vs. 39% (odds ratio 3.69 [95% CI(confidence interval): 1.31, 10.41]; p = .012). After 40 months median follow-up, median progression-free survival by independent radiology committee with VR-CAP vs. R-CHOP was 32.6 vs. 12.0 months (hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% CI: 0.31, 1.13]; p = .108); median overall survival was not reached vs. 47.3 months (HR 0.81 [95% CI: 0.33, 1.96]; p = .634). Adverse events included neutropenia (92/76%), thrombocytopenia (70/10%) and leukopenia (65/50%). VR-CAP represents a potential alternative to R-CHOP in combined and/or alternating regimens for younger, SCT-eligible MCL patients.

28146612	Risperidone	Hip Fractures	1	1	0	0	0.0	Antipsychotic Use and the Risk of Hip Fracture Among Community-Dwelling Persons With Alzheimer's Disease.	OBJECTIVE: To study whether antipsychotic use is associated with a risk of hip fracture among individuals with Alzheimer's disease and to compare the risk according to the duration of use and the 2 most frequently used antipsychotics. METHODS: The MEDALZ (Medication and Alzheimer's disease) cohort consisted of community-dwelling Finnish persons with clinically verified diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, including 70,718 persons newly diagnosed according to NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria between 2005 and 2011. Antipsychotic use was modeled from prescription register data, and hip fractures (ICD-10 S72.0-72.2) were identified from the Hospital Discharge Register. The incidence of hip fractures was compared between new users and nonusers of antipsychotics, among various time durations of antipsychotic use, and between quetiapine users and risperidone users. RESULTS: Antipsychotic use versus nonuse was associated with an increased risk of hip fractures (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.39-1.70). The risk was increased from the first days of use and remained increased thereafter. Quetiapine was associated with a similar risk of hip fracture as risperidone for the first 2.7 years of use (adjusted HR = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79-1.21). Compared with low-dose (</= 0.5 mg) risperidone use, higher risperidone doses (> 0.5 mg) were associated with a higher risk of hip fracture (adjusted HR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.32-2.24). CONCLUSIONS: Since the risk of hip fracture was increased from the first days of use, our results confirm the need for setting a high threshold for initiating antipsychotic use among persons with Alzheimer's disease to avoid serious adverse events. If antipsychotic use is initiated, the duration of use should be limited, as the risk of hip fracture does not attenuate with long-term use.
27136952	Tramadol	Adrenal Insufficiency	1	1	0	0	0.0	[Secondary adrenal insufficiency during opiate treatment].	A 25-year-old previously healthy man developed secondary adrenal insufficiency during opiate treatment with tramadol and morphine for upper back pain. He experienced a 10 kg weight loss in six weeks. MRI of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland ruled out cerebral pathology. After discontinuation of the opiate treatment the condition normalised. Opiate therapy can cause endocrine dysfunction, and clinicians should always consider adverse drug reactions as a differential diagnosis for unexplained symptoms.
29576120	Gabapentin	Respiratory Insufficiency	1	1	0	0	0.0	Pattern of perioperative gabapentinoid use and risk for postoperative naloxone administration.	BACKGROUND: Single preoperative gabapentinoid (gabapentin and pregabalin) administration has been associated with respiratory depression during Phase I anaesthesia recovery. In this study, we assess for associations between chronic (home) use and perioperative administration (preoperative and postoperative) of gabapentinoids, and risk for severe over-sedation or respiratory depression as inferred from the use of naloxone. METHODS: From 2011 to 2016, we identified patients undergoing general anaesthesia discharged to standard postoperative wards and administered naloxone within 48 h of surgery in a single centre. These patients were 2:1 matched on age, sex, and type of procedure. Patient and perioperative characteristics were abstracted and compared to assess for risk for naloxone administration. RESULTS: We identified 128 patients that received naloxone after operation [odds ratio 1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0, 1.4 per 1000 general anaesthetics]. Patients on chronic or postoperative gabapentinoid therapy were at significantly higher risk for receiving naloxone after operation. Multivariable analysis detected significant interactions between chronic and postoperative use of gabapentinoids, where continuation of chronic gabapentinoid medications into the postoperative period was associated with an increased rate of naloxone administration (6.30, 95% CI 2.4, 16.7; P=0.001). Obstructive sleep apnoea (P=0.005) and preoperative disability (P=0.003) were also associated with an increased risk for postoperative naloxone administration. Patients who received naloxone had longer hospital stays and higher rates of postoperative delirium. CONCLUSIONS: Continuation of chronic gabapentinoid medications into the postoperative period is associated with the increased use of naloxone to reverse over-sedation or respiratory depression. Such patients requiring this therapy warrant high levels of postoperative monitoring.

29150154	Clobetasol	Skin Neoplasms	1	1	0	0	0.0	Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) associated with cosmetic skin whitening: 8 cases reported in Senegal.	BACKGROUND: The cosmetic use of bleaching products is common among women from sub-Saharan Africa. The most frequently used products are highly potent corticosteroids (clobetasol propionate) and hydroquinone. Herein, we report 8 cases of SCC in women using skin bleaching products for cosmetic purposes. Our aim is to describe the epidemiological, clinical and pathological aspects of the carcinomas observed during the course of skin lightening. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive multicentre study from August 2005 to January 2016 in three dermatology units in Senegal. We included all patients consulting for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma associated with skin bleaching. Sociodemographic, clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic data were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 8 female patients were included. The mean age was 48.1 years (37-63 years). Topical hydroquinone and highly potent corticosteroids were the main products used over the whole body, for an average duration of 20.3 years. No pre-neoplastic skin disease was found in our patients. The clinical aspects of tumours were as follows: cauliflower-like (n=4), ulcerated (n=3) and nodular (n=1). The average development time before consultation was 6.75 months. All the cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas were localized to lichenoid lesions or exogenous ochronotic lesions on photo-exposed areas: face (n=1), neck (n=3) or upper back (n=4). The most common histopathological type was the infiltrating form and there was one case of in situ carcinoma. The outcome was favourable in six of eight patients after surgical resection. Two deaths occurred: one through tumour recurrence and the other through haemorrhagic shock. CONCLUSIONS: From 2005 to 2016, eight cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas associated with cosmetic use of bleaching products were reported in Senegal. The mechanism was not fully elucidated and further studies are necessary. These observations provide an additional argument for combating this practice and including skin bleaching among known risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma.
28867534	Vitamin K	Necrosis	1	1	0	1	1.0	[Vitamin K antagonist-induced necrotic leg ulcer, without protein C and S deficiencies].	INTRODUCTION: Patients treated by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) represent 1% of the population in France. We report a case of atypical necrotic leg ulcers induced by VKA. CASE REPORT: A 84-year-old woman was referred to our dermatology department because of necrotic leg ulcers that developed for the past 5weeks, and appeared spontaneously after the introduction of a VKA, fluindione. The etiological assessment was non contributive, in particular the search for thrombophilic factors. The skin biopsy found an aspect compatible with pyoderma gangrenosum. The outcome was favorable after discontinuing the fluindione and the switch to apixaban. A complete healing was obtained in 5months. CONCLUSION: We report an original case of necrotic leg ulcers induced by VKA without deficit of protein C or S, with a pyoderma like histology. Reported cases of ulcers induced by VKA are uncommon and the physiopathology is not well known. The involvement of VKA should be evoked in case of necrotic leg ulcer without specific etiology found.

BACKGROUND: Reactions to beta-lactams are frequent and it is difficult to establish the relationship between the drug and symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and explore the immunological mechanisms of patients with suspected adverse reaction to beta-lactams. METHODS: Retrospective study of patients with a history of beta-lactam reaction and tests for reactions to drugs. RESULTS: Out of 125 patients, 71 were women (56.8%); 73 had a history of immediate reaction and 52 delayed reaction; 590 allergy tests were done: specific IgE measurement, skin prick, patch, and provocation tests. The drugs most often related were amoxycillin, in 62 patients (49.6%), crystalline penicillin in 17 (13.6%), benzathine penicillin in 15 (12%), and cefalexin in 13 (10.4%). The severity of the reaction was mild in the majority (82%). 7.7% had a history of anaphylaxis and 10.8% sought care for a positive penicillin skin test, without history of reaction. Only 6.7% resulted in a positive test. More than 62% began testing two years after the reaction for which they sought care. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical history is insufficient to determine allergy to beta-lactams. In our sample, few patients with a history of beta-lactam reaction had evidence of immune-mediated reactions.

29383633	Calcium Gluconate	Hypercalcemia	1	1	0	0	0.0	A Fatal Case of Amlodipine Toxicity Following Iatrogenic Hypercalcemia.	Using calcium salts in management of amlodipine overdose is challenging. A 25-year-old male with known history of adult polycystic kidney disease presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and intact neurological status after ingestion of 450 mg of amlodipine. Immediately, normal saline infusion and norepinephrine were initiated. Two grams of calcium gluconate was injected, followed by intravenous infusion of 1.16 mg/kg/h. The patient was put on insulin-glucose protocol to maintain euglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Electrocardiography demonstrated junctional rhythm. Serum creatinine was 2.5 mg/dL with metabolic acidosis. By the end of 24 h post-admission, his consciousness, blood pressure, and urine output were normal. Almost 32 h post-admission, he became disoriented and his oxygen saturation decreased and therefore was mechanically ventilated. Second chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema. Serum calcium level increased to 26.1 mg/dL. Calcium was discontinued, and furosemide infusion and calcitonin were intravenously administrated. Urine output increased and hemodialysis improved pulmonary edema and serum calcium level with no change in consciousness. Three days after admission, the patient became anuric and developed multi-organ failure and died 5 days post-admission. To avoid the consequences of excessive infusion of calcium in renal failure patients, the minimum calcium dose with close monitoring is recommended.
30112725	Sumatriptan	Nausea	0	0	0	0		Efficacy and safety of DFN-11 (sumatriptan injection, 3 mg) in adults with episodic migraine: an 8-week open-label extension study.	BACKGROUND: DFN-11, a 3 mg sumatriptan subcutaneous (SC) autoinjector for acute treatment of migraine, has not been assessed previously in multiple attacks. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of DFN-11 in the acute treatment of multiple migraine attacks. METHODS: This was an 8-week open-label extension of multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled US study. Subjects averaging 2 to 6 episodic migraine attacks per month were randomized to DFN-11 or placebo to treat a single attack of moderate-to-severe intensity and then entered the extension study to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of DFN-11 in multiple attacks of any pain intensity. RESULTS: Overall, 234 subjects enrolled in the open-label period, and 29 (12.4%) discontinued early. A total of 848 migraine episodes were treated with 1042 doses of open-label DFN-11 and subjects treated a mean (SD) of 3.9 (2.3) attacks. At 2 h postdose in attacks 1 (N = 216), 2 (N = 186), 3 (N = 142) and 4 (N = 110), respectively, pain freedom rates were 57.6%, 64.6%, 61.6%, and 66.3%; pain relief rates were 83.4%, 88.4%, 84.1%, and 81.7%; most bothersome symptom (MBS)-free rates were 69.0%, 76.5%, 77.7%, and 74.7%; nausea-free rates were 78.1%, 84.6%, 86.5%, and 85.7%; photophobia-free rates were 75.3%, 76.4%, 72.3%, and 77.5%; and phonophobia-free rates were 75.2%, 77.5%, 73.6%, and 76.0%. Overall, 40.6% (89/219) of subjects reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), the most common of which were associated with the injection site: swelling (12.8%), pain (11.4%), irritation (6.4%), and bruising (6.4%). Most subjects (65.2%, 58/89) had mild TEAEs; severe TEAEs were reported by 1 subject (treatment-related jaw tightness). Five subjects (2.1%) discontinued due to adverse events, which included mild throat tightness (n = 2), moderate hernia pain (n = 1), moderate hypersensitivity (n = 1), and 1 subject with mild nausea and moderate injection site swelling. There were no serious TEAEs and no new or unexpected safety findings. CONCLUSION: DFN-11 was effective, tolerable, and safe in the acute treatment of 4 migraine attacks over 8 weeks, with consistent responses on pain and associated symptoms. Most TEAEs were mild, with a very low incidence of triptan-related TEAEs. DFN-11 is potentially an effective and safe alternative for the acute treatment of migraine.

Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and down regulates HER-2/neu expression in ductal breast tumors. Other HER-2/neu monoclonal antibodies, particularly trastuzumab, have been implicated to induce infusion related reactions such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Here, we report a case of pertuzumab associated CRS prior to infusion of trastuzumab which warranted hospitalization for symptom management.
30264291	Cisplatin	Neoplasms, Experimental	0	1	0	0		Ellagic acid ameliorates cisplatin toxicity in chemically induced colon carcinogenesis.	Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) (CP) is an important chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of several cancers. However, it has several side effects including nephrotoxicity gonadotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and ototoxicity. In in vitro experiments, antioxidants or reactive oxygen species scavengers have a cytoprotective effect on cells exposed to cisplatin (CP). Ellagic acid (EA) is one such bioactive polyphenol that is abundant in some fruits, nuts, and seeds. Various authors have reported that EA has strong antioxidant and antitumor potential. The present study was, therefore, carried out to explore the protective potential of EA on CP-induced gonadotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in colon tumor-bearing mice. Animals were divided into five groups: Group I: normal control, Group II: DMH treated. After 20 weeks of DMH treatment, the animals were divided into four subgroups, viz., Group III: no treatment, Group IV: EA, Group V: CP, and Group VI: CP + EA. Administration of EA significantly ameliorated the toxicity caused by CP as indicated by improved kidney function tests and reproductive function tests. EA treatment to CP-abused mice also led to a marked reduction in the extent of peroxidative damage to tissue as was evident from the improvement in the histopathological changes in kidney and testis. Blood counts were also improved on administration of EA to CP-treated mice. This article provides the evidence that antioxidant efficacy of EA has beneficial effects on CP-induced nephrotoxicity and gonadotoxicity and contributes to understanding the role of oxidative stress, and suggests several points as part of the mechanism of CP toxicity.

29905899	Aripiprazole	Basal Ganglia Diseases	0	0	0	0		Efficacy and safety of aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia: an overview of systematic reviews.	"PURPOSE: To conduct an overview to summarize the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, for articles published until March 31, 2017. We included systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy, and/or the safety of aripiprazole, for patients with schizophrenia. Two authors independently performed the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and the Risk of Bias in Systematic Review (ROBIS) tool were used to appraise the quality of evidence and the risk of bias in the reviews, respectively. RESULTS: Fourteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Aripiprazole showed efficacy similar to that of both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs (except olanzapine and amisulpride). Aripiprazole caused significantly lower weight gain and alterations in glucose and cholesterol levels, as compared to clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. In addition, aripiprazole caused significantly fewer general extrapyramidal side effects, less use of antiparkinsonian drugs, and akathisia, compared with typical antipsychotic drugs and risperidone. The overall quality of evidence in the reviews ranged from ""very low"" to ""moderate,"" principally because of the risk of bias of original trials, inconsistency, and imprecision in the outcomes. According to the ROBIS tool, there are four reviews with ""high"" risk of bias and five with ""unclear"" risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Aripiprazole exhibited efficacy similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs and a better safety profile than that of typical (i.e., less some extrapyramidal side effects) and atypical (i.e., less metabolic changes) antipsychotic drugs."
28230638	Sirolimus	Atherosclerosis	1	1	0	0	0.0	mTOR Inhibition and Cardiovascular Diseases: Dyslipidemia and Atherosclerosis.	Inhibitors of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) have unique antiatherosclerotic effects, such as depletion of plaque macrophages, induction of autophagy, and activation of cholesterol efflux. However, a common side effect of their use is dyslipidemia, a well-known risk factor for atherosclerosis. Indeed, mTOR inhibitors prevent lipid storage, increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and activate lipolysis. Although the net effect of mTOR inhibition seems favorable, the use of cholesterol lowering drugs to manage dyslipidemia remains the most recommended strategy.

30032885	Ketamine	Nausea	0	0	0	0		Determination of the median effective dose of propofol in combination with different doses of ketamine during gastro-duodenoscopy in children: a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Propofol is used to induce deep sedation or general anaesthesia for procedures in children. Adjuvants, such as ketamine, are routinely added to reduce the dose of propofol required and propofol-related adverse events. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to determine the effective bolus dose of propofol in combination with ketamine that induces adequate depth of anaesthesia in 50% of children (ED(50)) undergoing gastro-duodenoscopy. METHODS: Children were randomised to one of four doses of ketamine: 0 (control), 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg kg(-1), followed by a dose of propofol according to Dixon's up-and-down methodology. Excessive movement, coughing, gagging, or airway obstruction that prevented endoscope insertion was considered a failure. RESULTS: The ED(50) of propofol (median, 95% CI) was greater in the ketamine 0, 0.25, and 0.5 mg kg(-1) groups compared with the ketamine 1 mg kg(-1) group (6.1, 4.1-8.1; 4.5, 2.9-6; 4.7, 3.1-6.2 mg kg(-1)vs 1.1, 0.5-1.8 mg kg(-1), respectively, P<0.008). Total dose of propofol administered during the procedure was reduced with ketamine 1 mg kg(-1). The mean arterial pressure was lower in the ketamine 0 mg kg(-1) group compared with the 1 mg kg(-1) group during and immediately after the procedure. The ketamine 1 mg kg(-1) group experienced a higher incidence of nausea and visual disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine at 0.5-1 mg kg(-1) reduces the dose of propofol required to provide general anaesthesia for gastro-duodenoscopy in children and may reduce the incidence of propofol-related changes in haemodynamics. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 02295553.

METHODS: Children were randomised to one of four doses of ketamine: 0 (control), 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg kg(-1), followed by a dose of propofol according to Dixon's up-and-down methodology. Excessive movement, coughing, gagging, or airway obstruction that prevented endoscope insertion was considered a failure. RESULTS: The ED(50) of propofol (median, 95% CI) was greater in the ketamine 0, 0.25, and 0.5 mg kg(-1) groups compared with the ketamine 1 mg kg(-1) group (6.1, 4.1-8.1; 4.5, 2.9-6; 4.7, 3.1-6.2 mg kg(-1)vs 1.1, 0.5-1.8 mg kg(-1), respectively, P<0.008). Total dose of propofol administered during the procedure was reduced with ketamine 1 mg kg(-1). The mean arterial pressure was lower in the ketamine 0 mg kg(-1) group compared with the 1 mg kg(-1) group during and immediately after the procedure. The ketamine 1 mg kg(-1) group experienced a higher incidence of nausea and visual disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine at 0.5-1 mg kg(-1) reduces the dose of propofol required to provide general anaesthesia for gastro-duodenoscopy in children and may reduce the incidence of propofol-related changes in haemodynamics.

30043130	Imatinib Mesylate	Exanthema	0	0	0	0		Pattern of Use and Long-Term Safety of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: A Decade of Real-World Management of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: First-line treatment of chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is based on the first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib or the second-generation TKIs dasatinib or nilotinib. Thanks to the efficacy of TKIs, CML has switched from a fatal to a 'chronic' pathology, and data from clinical trials have become insufficient to drive physicians' prescription choices and address long-term treatment outcomes. On the brink of commercialization of generic imatinib, this study aims to evaluate the therapeutic pattern of CP-CML and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) over a decade of local real clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed on CP-CML patients followed up in the Local Health Unit of Treviso (Veneto Region, Italy) during the period 2005-2015. Data were captured from both administrative databases and physicians' patient diaries. RESULTS: Of 81 CP-CML patients, 73 were treated with first-line imatinib; among the second-generation TKIs, only nilotinib was used (n = 8). Overall, 38% of imatinib-treated subjects needed to switch, mainly due to intolerance, whereas no switches occurred in the nilotinib cohort. Osteoarticular pain was the most common AE and was significantly more frequent in the imatinib cohort (68.49 vs. 25.00%, p = 0.022). Other common AEs were dermatologic manifestations, asthenia, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Although based on a small population, this study represents an unbiased reference on the long-term management of CML in an Italian clinical setting. Our results indicate a better profile of first-line nilotinib, both in terms of persistency and tolerability. AEs remain a major concern, highlighting the importance of close monitoring.

"Eastern Estonia has large oil shale mines and industrial facilities mainly focused on electricity generation from oil shale and shale oil extraction, which produce high air pollution emissions. The ""Study of the health impact of the oil shale sector-SOHOS"" was aimed at identifying the impacts on residents' health and annoyance due to the industrial processing. First, a population-wide survey about health effects and annoyance was carried out. Second, the total and oil shale sectors' emitted concentrations of benzene, phenol, and PM(2.5) were modelled. Third, the differences between groups were tested and relationships between health effects and environmental pollution studied using multiple regression analysis. Compared to the control groups from non-industrial areas in Tartu or Laane-Viru, residents of Ida-Viru more frequently (p < 0.05) reported wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, asthma attacks, a long-term cough, hypertension, heart diseases, myocardial infarction, stroke, and diabetes. All health effects except asthma were reported more frequently among non-Estonians. People living in regions with higher levels of PM(2.5), had significantly higher odds (p < 0.05) of experiencing chest tightness (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.26), shortness of breath (1.16, 1.03-1.31) or an asthma attack (1.22, 1.04-1.42) during the previous year. People living in regions with higher levels of benzene had higher odds of experiencing myocardial infarction (1.98, 1.11-3.53) and with higher levels of phenol chest tightness (1.44, 1.03-2.00), long-term cough (1.48, 1.06-2.07) and myocardial infarction (2.17, 1.23-3.83). The prevalence of adverse health effects was also higher among those who had been working in the oil shale sector. Next to direct health effects, up to a quarter of the residents of Ida-Viru County were highly annoyed about air pollution. Perceived health risk from air pollution increased the odds of being annoyed. Annoyed people in Ida-Viru had significantly higher odds of experiencing respiratory symptoms during the last 12 months, e.g., wheezing (2.30, 1.31-4.04), chest tightness (2.88, 1.91-4.33 or attack of coughing (1.99, 1.34-2.95)."

30184451	Rituximab	Neutropenia	0	0	0	0		Rituximab plus Lenalidomide in Advanced Untreated Follicular Lymphoma.	BACKGROUND: Rituximab plus chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in patients with advanced-stage, previously untreated follicular lymphoma; nevertheless, most patients will have a relapse. Combination immunotherapy with lenalidomide and rituximab is an immunomodulatory regimen that has shown promising activity in patients with indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. METHODS: We conducted this multicenter, international, phase 3 superiority trial to evaluate rituximab plus lenalidomide, as compared with rituximab plus chemotherapy, in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the two regimens, followed by maintenance monotherapy with rituximab. Treatment with rituximab plus lenalidomide consisted of 18 cycles of the two drugs, followed by rituximab maintenance therapy every 8 weeks for 12 cycles (six additional doses). Treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy consisted of the investigator's choice of one of three rituximab-based regimens, followed by maintenance monotherapy with rituximab every 8 weeks for 12 cycles. The primary end points were complete response (confirmed or unconfirmed) at 120 weeks and progression-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 1030 patients were randomly assigned to receive rituximab plus lenalidomide (513 patients) or rituximab plus chemotherapy (517 patients). The rate of confirmed or unconfirmed complete response at 120 weeks was similar in the two groups: 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44 to 53) in the rituximab-lenalidomide group and 53% (95% CI, 49 to 57) in the rituximab-chemotherapy group (P=0.13). The interim 3-year rate of progression-free survival was 77% (95% CI, 72 to 80) and 78% (95% CI, 74 to 82), respectively. A higher percentage of patients in the rituximab-chemotherapy group had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (32% vs. 50%) and febrile neutropenia of any grade (2% vs. 7%), and a higher percentage of patients in the rituximab-lenalidomide group had grade 3 or 4 cutaneous reactions (7% vs. 1%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, efficacy results were similar with rituximab plus lenalidomide and rituximab plus chemotherapy (with both regimens followed by rituximab maintenance therapy). The safety profile differed in the two groups. (Funded by Celgene; RELEVANCE ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01476787 and NCT01650701 , and EudraCT number, 2011-002792-42 .).

30608393	Guanine	Carcinoma, Hepatocellular	1	0	0	0		High percentage atypical hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs.	Nucleos(t)ide analogs are used for preventing liver cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B patients, but the risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in these patients remain unclear. We designed this retrospective cohort study, the aim is to determine the risk factors for HCC development and its image presentation under nucleos(t)ide analogs treatment.In this study, patients were treated with lamivudine (LAM), entecavir 0.5 mg (ETV), or telbivudine (LdT), and followed-up for at least 2 years to detect HCC and its presentation. Assessment of the risk factors for HCC included age, sex, HBeAg, viral load, liver cirrhosis, current and previous medications, and liver function tests.Totally, 396 patients were recruited, and 18 patients developed HCC. The mean time from the treatment to HCC development was 28.5 +/- 16.7 months. The clinical characteristics in HCC and no-HCC groups showed significant differences among age (52.8 +/- 6.1 vs 47.1 +/- 12.6 years, P <.01), baseline alanine transaminase (ALT) levels (161.4 +/- 177.3 vs 361.7 +/- 496.3, P <.01), and baseline liver cirrhosis (72.2% vs 29.9%, P <.01). In patients aged >/=45 years, the hazard ratio of HCC was 10.2 and liver cirrhosis was 4.1. Majority of HCCs developed in the right liver (14/18), were single numbered (13/18), had tumor size about 1.9 +/- 0.7 cm, were classified as T1 (14/18, TNM staging), and the atypical image occupied 88% of the HCC cases.The patients aged >==45 years on long-term nucleos(t)ide analog therapy, and with baseline liver cirrhosis were at a high risk of HCC. Regular alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) assessment and image study of these patients are the gold standards for early HCC detection in patients with high percentage atypical HCC appearances.

30413837	Cyclophosphamide	Anemia	0	0	0	0		Phase 1 study of everolimus and low-dose oral cyclophosphamide in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.	mTOR inhibitors are frequently used in the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival, and additionally plays an important role in immune regulation. Since mTOR inhibitors were shown to benefit immunosuppressive regulatory T-cell (Treg) expansion, this might suppress antitumor immune responses. Metronomic cyclophosphamide (CTX) was shown to selectively deplete Tregs. This study was, therefore, designed to determine the optimal dosage and schedule of CTX when combined with everolimus to prevent this potentially detrimental Treg expansion. In this national multi-center phase I study, patients with mRCC progressive on first line anti-angiogenic therapy received 10 mg everolimus once daily and were enrolled into cohorts with different CTX dosages and schedules. Besides immune monitoring, adverse events and survival data were monitored. 40 patients, 39 evaluable, were treated with different doses and schedules of CTX. Combined with 10 mg everolimus once daily, the optimal Treg depleting dose and schedule of CTX was 50 mg CTX once daily. 23 (59%) patients experienced one or more treatment-related >/= grade 3 toxicity, mostly fatigue, laboratory abnormalities and pneumonitis. The majority of the patients achieved stable disease, two patients a partial response. Median PFS of all cohorts was 3.5 months. In conclusion, the optimal Treg depleting dose and schedule of CTX, when combined with everolimus, is 50 mg once daily. This combination leads to acceptable adverse events in comparison with everolimus alone. Currently, the here selected combination is being evaluated in a phase II clinical trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01462214.

Since mTOR inhibitors were shown to benefit immunosuppressive regulatory T-cell (Treg) expansion, this might suppress antitumor immune responses. Metronomic cyclophosphamide (CTX) was shown to selectively deplete Tregs. This study was, therefore, designed to determine the optimal dosage and schedule of CTX when combined with everolimus to prevent this potentially detrimental Treg expansion. In this national multi-center phase I study, patients with mRCC progressive on first line anti-angiogenic therapy received 10 mg everolimus once daily and were enrolled into cohorts with different CTX dosages and schedules. Besides immune monitoring, adverse events and survival data were monitored. 40 patients, 39 evaluable, were treated with different doses and schedules of CTX. Combined with 10 mg everolimus once daily, the optimal Treg depleting dose and schedule of CTX was 50 mg CTX once daily. 23 (59%) patients experienced one or more treatment-related >/= grade 3 toxicity, mostly fatigue, laboratory abnormalities and pneumonitis. The majority of the patients achieved stable disease, two patients a partial response. Median PFS of all cohorts was 3.5 months. In conclusion, the optimal Treg depleting dose and schedule of CTX, when combined with everolimus, is 50 mg once daily. This combination leads to acceptable adverse events in comparison with everolimus alone. Currently, the here selected combination is being evaluated in a phase II clinical trial.

29879312	Cyclophosphamide	Infertility, Female	1	0	0	0		Effect of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog for ovarian function preservation after intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus patients: a retrospective inception cohort study.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of leuprolide acetate, a synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRH-a) on ovarian function preservation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients treated with cyclophosphamide (CYC) in clinical practice. METHODS: We enrolled 30 premenopausal female SLE patients who fulfilled the 1997 American College of Rheumatology revised criteria and were treated with intravenous CYC (IVCY) in 2008-2017. We used Kaplan-Meier survival estimates to compare the GnRH-a-treated patients and those not treated with GnRH-a as controls. We performed Cox regression analyses to identify factors associated with premature ovarian failure (POF), incidences of cardiovascular events, strokes and osteoporosis after IVCY therapy. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 41 months, POF developed in one of the 16 GnRH-a-treated patients (6%) versus seven of the 14 controls (50%). Significantly improved cumulative ovarian protection over time was observed in the GnRH-a-treated group (P = 0.030). The hazard model analysis showed that treatment with GnRH-a during IVCY therapy is an independent factor associated with POF after IVCY therapy (adjusted hazards ratio = 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.67, P = 0.013) but not incidences of cardiovascular events, strokes or osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: The combined use of GnRH-a with IVCY therapy was associated with a significant reduction of POF among premenopausal women with SLE, suggesting that the addition of GnRH-a can be a strategy to prevent POF among premenopausal women with SLE after IVCY therapy.

Nivolumab is an anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody that is utilized as an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for cancer therapy. We herein present the case of a 57-year-old man who developed acute kidney injury during treatment with nivolumab for lung cancer. A renal biopsy revealed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated marked infiltration of macrophages and T cells together with mild B cell infiltration. Of note, strong CD163(+) M2 macrophage infiltration was observed. The cessation of nivolumab and high-dose prednisolone therapy improved the renal function of the patient. Further, we review the pertinent literature on renal-infiltrating cells in ICI-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis.
28607509	Cyclophosphamide	Hematologic Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Genetic background influences susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced hematotoxicity.	Hematotoxicity is a life-threatening side effect of many chemotherapy regimens. Although clinical factors influence patient responses, genetic factors may also play an important role. We sought to identify genomic loci that influence chemotherapy-induced hematotoxicity by dosing Diversity Outbred mice with one of three chemotherapy drugs; doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide or docetaxel. We observed that each drug had a distinct effect on both the changes in blood cell subpopulations and the underlying genetic architecture of hematotoxicity. For doxorubicin, we mapped the change in cell counts before and after dosing and found that alleles of ATP-binding cassette B1B (Abcb1b) on chromosome 5 influence all cell populations. For cyclophosphamide and docetaxel, we found that each cell population was influenced by distinct loci, none of which overlapped between drugs. These results suggest that susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced hematotoxicity is influenced by different genes for different chemotherapy drugs.

30014486	Bevacizumab	Thrombotic Microangiopathies	1	1	0	1	0.0	Characteristic morphological changes in anti-VEGF therapy-induced glomerular microangiopathy.	AIMS: Agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have increasingly been used for the treatment of advanced malignancies, and have been found to induce renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and proteinuria. However, histomorphological changes in human biopsies in this setting and the underlying mechanism are not yet fully understood. Therefore, we collected renal biopsy cases with a history of aVEGF therapy to review and compare morphological kidney changes in this context. METHODS AND RESULTS: Renal biopsies of 15 patients who had received anti-VEGF (aVEGF) therapy evaluated between 2013 and 2017 at a single centre were morphologically characterised with light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry (IgA, IgG, IgM, C1q, and C3), and compared with cases with acute TMA caused by atypical haemolytic-uraemic syndrome or hypertension. Morphological overlap with immune complex and cryoglobulinaemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, diabetic glomerulopathy and pre-eclampsia-induced glomerulopathy are discussed. Segmental glomerular capillary microaneurysms and segmental hyalinosis were typical morphological features of aVEGF therapy-induced glomerular microangiopathy, whereas fibrin or platelet thrombi or fragmented erythrocytes were rarely found or were absent. aVEGF therapy-associated microangiopathy was diffusely distributed in the glomeruli, spared preglomerular vessels, and showed morphological characteristics of chronic TMA. In individual cases, aVEGF therapy-induced glomerular microangiopathy was accompanied by immune-complex glomerulonephritis. CONCLUSION: aVEGF therapy-induced glomerular microangiopathy has a characteristic morphology and clinical presentation that helps to differentiate it from other causes of TMA. Awareness of these light microscopic findings allows identification of aVEGF therapy as a trigger of renal disease in critically ill cancer patients, and might therefore help in deciding on further therapy.

A 65-year-old man with treatment-resistant psoriatic arthritis, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) presented with herpes simplex virus (HSV) oral ulcers and a recent 15 lb weight loss due to reduced consumption. Five weeks previously, his methotrexate was tapered and he had begun taking azathioprine. The patient's thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity level was normal prior to starting azathioprine. He was found to have pancytopenia with normal folate levels and azathioprine was discontinued. His pancytopenia worsened, with a nadir 8 days after stopping azathioprine, before returning to normal levels. His oral ulcers improved and he was able to tolerate solid food. This case illustrates that decreased TPMT activity is not the only risk factor for pancytopenia as an adverse reaction to azathioprine. Furthermore, HSV stomatitis may be the presenting symptom of pancytopenia. The timeline of improvement in cell counts illustrated in this patient has implications for the management of suspected azathioprine-induced pancytopenia.

28802086	Oxymorphone	Acute Kidney Injury	1	1	0	0	0.0	Acute kidney injury is common with intravenous abuse of extended-release oral oxymorphone and delayed renal recovery rates are associated with increased KDIGO staging.	AIM: Prescription opioid abuse poses a serious problem in the United States, representing 615 per 100 000 deaths annually. Extended-release oxymorphone (Opana-ER) is an oral opioid pain medication that has recently been found to cause thrombotic microangiopathy when intravenously abused. In this retrospective study, we attempted to determine the prevalence and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) among patients intravenously abusing extended-release oral oxymorphone. METHODS: A query of electronic medical records for 'drug abuse' at an academic medical centre during January 2012 to December 2015 was performed and yielded 2350 patients. Patients were further identified by documented intravenous abuse of extended-release oxymorphone. Patients were stratified based on multiple renal indices and outcomes. Potential confounders were also identified. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were found to have a documented history of intravenous abuse of extended-release oral oxymorphone. Prevalence of AKI in this population was a 47.8%. KDIGO stage-I patients consisted of 17.8% of patients with AKI, 40.5% were classified as KDIGO stage-II AKI, and 41.8% were classified as KDIGO stage-III AKI. Among patients with AKI, average age was found to be 37.5 years, 59.4% experienced renal recovery, 56.9% required intensive care unit admission, 13.9% progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and 7.6% expired during admission. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be educated to help recognize intravenous abuse of extended-release oral oxymorphone and its associated effects. Our data suggests AKI is common in these patients; higher KDIGO staging appears to be associated with slower rates of renal recovery, increased comorbidities and progression to both CKD and ESRD.

Here, we report a 36-year-old man receiving peritoneal dialysis developed progressive paralysis in lower extremities, vision loss and hoarseness 4 months after anti-TB treatment with INH, EMB and rifapentine because of concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis. A diagnosis of EMB/INH-induced peripheral neuropathy, retrobulbar neuritis and laryngoparalysis was made. The patient's neuropathy gradually improved 2 years after discontinuation of EMB/INH. Since EMB and INH may cause simultaneously severe and complex multineuropathy in dialysis patients, their adverse effects should be closely supervised in dialysis patients.

30297131	Buprenorphine	Constipation	0	0	0	0		Colon constipation in horses after sustained-release buprenorphine administration.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacological profile and side effects of buprenorphine administered as a sustained-release formulation in horses. STUDY DESIGN: Pilot trial. ANIMALS: A total of four experimental horses, aged 18-27 years and weighing 508-578 kg. METHODS: Buprenorphine (0.1 mg kg(-1)) was mixed as a freshly prepared sterile solution with a sustained-release drug carrier. It was administered by the subcutaneous (n = 2) or intramuscular (n = 2) route. During the experiment, the horses were closely monitored, equipped with a step counter and blood samples were collected for quantification of buprenorphine in plasma. RESULTS: All four horses developed colon constipation requiring medical therapy, together with increased locomotor activity. One horse, requiring surgical treatment of colon constipation, was euthanized during recovery from anaesthesia for weakness and severe lower airway obstruction. The three other horses recovered fully within 5-7 days. Plasma buprenorphine concentrations were between 1 and 8 ng mL(-1) for approximately 48 hours. No local reaction was observed at the injection sites. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Administration of the sustained-release formulation of buprenorphine at a dose of 0.1 mg kg(-1) resulted in plasma concentrations compatible with antinociceptive activity for at least 48 hours. The observed severe and undesirable effects of colon constipation and increased locomotor activity definitely preclude clinical use of sustained-release buprenorphine at this dose.

Doxorubicin (DOX) is a broad-spectrum antitumor drug while its use is limited due to its neurobiological side effects associated with depression. We investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of dl-3-n-butylphthalide (dl-NBP) against DOX-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rats. dl-NBP was given (30 mg/kg) daily by gavage over three weeks starting seven days before DOX administration. Elevated plus maze (EPM) test, forced swimming test (FST), and sucrose preference test (SPT) were performed to assess anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Our study showed that the supplementation of dl-NBP significantly mitigated the behavioral changes induced by DOX. To further explore the mechanism of neuroprotection induced by dl-NBP, several biomarkers including oxidative stress markers, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers, and neuroinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus were quantified. The results showed that dl-NBP treatment alleviated DOX-induced neural apoptosis. Meanwhile, DOX-induced oxidative stress and ER stress in the hippocampus were significantly ameliorated in dl-NBP pretreatment group. Our study found that dl-NBP alleviated the upregulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), CHOP, glucose-regulated protein 78 kD (GRP-78), and caspase-12 and increased the levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the hippocampus of rats exposed to DOX. Additionally, the gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were significantly increased in DOX-treated group, whereas DOX-induced neuroinflammation was significantly attenuated in dl-NBP supplementation group. In conclusion, dl-NBP could alleviate DOX-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors via attenuating oxidative stress, ER stress, inflammatory reaction, and neural apoptosis, providing a basis as a therapeutic potential against DOX-induced neurotoxicity.
29910082	Brimonidine Tartrate	Uveitis, Anterior	1	1	0	0	0.0	Hypertensive acute granulomatous anterior uveitis as a side effect of topical brimonidine.	CLINICAL CASE: The case concerns an 81-year-old woman on treatment with a topical fixed combination of timolol and brimonidine who was diagnosed in the Emergency Department with acute anterior granulomatous hypertensive uveitis. The patient responded favourably to the withdrawal of the eye drops without showing any subsequent relapse. DISCUSSION: Uveitis due to brimonidine is a rare adverse effect, but it must be known. Once the diagnosis is suspected, the effective treatment is the withdrawal of brimonidine, with or without the addition of topical corticosteroids to control inflammation depending on the severity of the condition. It is a process with an excellent prognosis.
30116943	Afatinib	Diarrhea	0	0	0	0		Multi-disciplinary proactive follow-up algorithm for patients with advanced NSCLC receiving afatinib.	PURPOSE: Afatinib is a standard first-line therapy for advanced EGFR-positive NSCLC. We implemented a pharmacist-led proactive follow-up algorithm to identify and manage early afatinib-related adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients treated with afatinib after implementation of the algorithm at the Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre (Toronto, ON, Canada) from April 1, 2015 to July 31, 2016. Our in-house algorithm involved consultations in person and proactive pharmacist-led callbacks on days 5, 10, and 17. All AEs were graded and documented in real time and management based on toxicity grade was standardized. This study evaluated the impact of our algorithm on real-world AEs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Thirty-three patients were identified and reviewed. Median follow-up was 248 days. All patients experienced at least one drug-related AE; 18.2% were grade 3/4. The most common AEs were diarrhea 87.9%, rash 81.8%, stomatitis 57.6%, and paronychia 45.5%. Median dose of afatinib was 40 mg daily; 51.5% of patients had >/= 1 dose reduction and 6.3% discontinued afatinib due to AEs. Proactive calls by the pharmacist identified 36.5% of all drug-related AEs, 33.3% of grade 3/4 AEs, 58.1% of first drug-related AEs and identified two patients that were non-compliant. Only 3.2% of AEs were identified by an emergency room/urgent clinic visit. CONCLUSIONS: This proactive multi-disciplinary AE management algorithm resulted in a low rate of urgent assessments and discontinuation due to toxicity while maintaining afatinib at ideal dose, thus providing a useful tool for centers prescribing afatinib.
30069864	Bevacizumab	Thrombosis	0	0	0	0		Real-World Safety of Intravitreal Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab Treatments for Retinal Diseases in Thailand: A Prospective Observational Study.	BACKGROUND: There is very limited evidence examining serious systemic adverse events (SSAEs) and post-injection endophthalmitis of intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) and intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) treatments in Thailand and low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, findings from the existing trials might have limited generalizability to certain populations and rare SSAEs. OBJECTIVES: This prospective observational study aimed to assess and compare the safety profiles of IVB and IVR in patients with retinal diseases in Thailand. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2015, 6354 patients eligible for IVB or IVR were recruited from eight hospitals. Main outcomes measures were prevalence and risk of SSAEs, mortality, and endophthalmitis during the 6-month follow-up period. RESULTS: In the IVB and IVR groups, 94 and 6% of patients participated, respectively. The rates of outcomes in the IVB group were slightly greater than in the IVR group. All-cause mortality rates in the IVB and IVR groups were 1.10 and 0.53%, respectively. Prevalence rates of endophthalmitis and non-fatal strokes in the IVB group were 0.04% of 16,421 injections and 0.27% of 5975 patients, respectively, whereas none of these events were identified in the IVR group. There were no differences between the two groups in the risks of mortality, arteriothrombotic events (ATE), and non-fatal heart failure (HF). Adjustment for potential confounding factors and selection bias using multivariable models for time-to-event outcomes and propensity scores did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of SAEs in both groups were low. The IVB and IVR treatments were not associated with significant risks of mortality, ATE, and non-fatal HF.

30381161	Pregabalin	Myoclonus	1	1	0	0	0.0	Gabapentin or pregabalin induced myoclonus: A case series and literature review.	"Gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB) are FDA approved for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures and for treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. Both drugs are primarily eliminated by renal excretion. However, PGB or GBP induced myoclonus has only been reported infrequently in case reports/series. It is not discussed with patients and its sudden occurrence can lead to anxiety because of ""seizure-like"" nature. In addition, first-contact physicians might treat it as seizures, leading to unnecessary tests and aggressive management. Medical records of patients who had myoclonus because of PGB or GBP seen by Neurology service between Jan & May 2017 in inpatient or outpatient setting at our tertiary care setting were reviewed. We identified six patients who were on either GBP or PGB or both who developed likely subcortical myoclonus in the setting of renal insufficiency and one patient who developed myoclonus independent of renal dysfunction. Our results indicate that myoclonus is commonly seen in patients in various clinical settings with or without renal insufficiency, and is independent of the severity of the renal failure. However, this is a reversible side effect of medication and it resolves either by discontinuing the medication, removing the medication with hemodialysis or by improvement of renal dysfunction. With a high index of suspicion, aggressive testing and treatment for other possible conditions like seizures (in non-epilepsy patients) or CNS infections can be avoided. In patients with renal failure and with decreased physiological renal clearance such as the elderly, GBP or PGB dose initiation and changes should be conservative."
30235756	Oseltamivir	Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage	1	1	0	1	1.0	Case report on alimentary tract hemorrhage and liver injury after therapy with oseltamivir: A case report.	RATIONALE: Oseltamivir-induced alimentary tract hemorrhage and liver injury are rarely reported in children and adult individuals. In this study, we described the clinical features and outcomes of oseltamivir-induced alimentary tract hemorrhage and liver injury in a child. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here, we present a case of a 6-year-old Asian boy with hematemesis and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (80 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (69 U/L) levels on day 2 of oseltamivir administration. The presence of alimentary tract hemorrhage and liver injury was diagnosed. The ALT level reached 1931.3 U/L, accompanied by an increase in total bilirubin (TBIL) to 53.3 mumol/L on day 15 after oseltamivir administration. Additional tests were performed to determine the presence of viruses that can cause hepatitis and autoantibodies, and the results from these tests were all negative. DIAGNOSIS: Drug-induced liver injury was considered. INTERVENTIONS: This patient was treated with compound glycyrrhizin and reduced glutathione and glucocorticoid. OUTCOMES: The liver enzymes recovered within 6 weeks without any symptoms of liver-related diseases after treatment with glucocorticoid. This treatment therefore helps reduce ALT and TBIL levels and protects the liver from further injury. LESSONS: Oral oseltamivir is widely used to treat influenza and the adverse effects of this drug were mostly mild. However, clinicians should always be alert for oseltamivir-induced alimentary tract hemorrhage and liver injury when prescribing oseltamivir for children.

29305999	Fluorouracil	Bone Marrow Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	High fat diet-induced obesity exacerbates hematopoiesis deficiency and cytopenia caused by 5-fluorouracil via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.	The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of a high-fat diet (HFD) on hematopoietic system recovery under stress condition caused by 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) and to evaluate the alleviating benefit of proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) inhibition on aggravation of 5-Fu-induced toxicity under HFD. Survival rates of HFD or normal diet (ND) mice were monitored after 5-Fu injection. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the progenitor cells in bone marrow were detected at various time points after 5-Fu administration by flow cytometry. Genes expressed in stem cell and platelet proliferation was tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The blood cell profile and coagulation function were determined with an ADVIA 120 hematology system and rotational thromboelastometry, respectively. None of HFD mice remained alive after 5-Fu injection, whereas 87.4% of ND mice survived. HFD accelerated 5-Fu-induced myelosuppression and cytopenia in the circulation, reflected by the worse recovery of HSCs and myeloid progenitor cells. In HFD mice, the number of platelets significantly decreased, and the Vcam-1/Vla-4 signal pathway was downregulated in bone marrow. Meanwhile, mice receiving HFD exhibited dysfunction of blood coagulation with increased clotting formation time. However, pretreatment of HFD mice with bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), the PPAR-gamma antagonist, reversed the acute lethal toxicity and bone marrow suppression of 5-Fu and accelerated the recovery of HSCs and platelets. In the light of these results, HFD could exacerbate 5-Fu-induced bone marrow toxicity and cytopenia. BADGE treatment offers a potential strategy to alleviate the aggravated hematopoiesis under an HFD.
29150351	Ethinyl Estradiol	Breast Neoplasms	1	0	0	0		Combined Hormonal Contraceptive Use and Risk of Breast Cancer in a Population of Women With a Family History.	BACKGROUND: We estimated the association between combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use and breast cancer (BC) incidence in a well-selected population of women at familial risk of BC at the Modena Family Cancer Clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study by reviewing the data from 2527 women (4.5% BRCA mutation carriers, 72.2% high risk, and 23.3% intermediate risk using the Modena criteria and the Tyrer-Cuzick model). RESULTS: We did not find any specific feature of breast cancer (infiltration, hormone receptor and HER2 status, onset before age 35 years, multiple diagnoses) in the CHC users (P > .05). Only 2.0% of women used a preparation with >/= 50 mug of ethinylestradiol (EE). The use of CHCs was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (cumulative hazard: never used, 0.17; CHC users, 0.20; P = .998), regardless of the duration of use (cumulative hazard: never used, 0.17, used < 5 years, 0.20; used 5-10 years, 0.14; used > 10 years, 0.25; P = .414). This was confirmed for the different risk groups when interacted in a Cox proportional hazard regression model. The EE dose did not influence the risk of BC (cumulative hazard, 2.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-10.1; never used, 0.18; EE < 20 mug used, 0.04; EE >/= 20 mug used, 0.16; P = .259). The types of progestins used might influence the risk, with some, such as gestodene (P = .028) and cyproterone acetate (P = .031), associated with an even greater reduced risk. CONCLUSIONS: CHC use does not increase the risk of BC in a population of women with a family history, encouraging CHC use in this group of women.
29494421	Dexamethasone	Hematologic Diseases	0	1	0	0		Phase II Clinical Trial of Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone Therapy in Japanese Elderly Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma to Determine Optimal Plasma Concentration of Lenalidomide.	BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a phase II clinical trial of lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination therapy in Japanese elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to evaluate its safety and efficacy and to determine whether safety and efficacy correlate with the plasma concentration of lenalidomide. METHODS: Forty patients received oral lenalidomide on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle in addition to weekly doses of dexamethasone. Plasma concentrations of lenalidomide were measured, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) of lenalidomide was predicted using a formula the authors previously reported in this journal. RESULTS: The median age was 75.5 years. Twenty-one patients had renal impairment severe enough to require dose adjustment of lenalidomide. The median initial doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone were 12.5 and 20 mg, respectively. The overall response rate was 68.6%, and the 2-year overall survival rate was 88.5%. There was no correlation between the response rate and plasma concentration of lenalidomide. Grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) were observed in 57.5% of patients. The AUC0-24 of lenalidomide was significantly higher in patients with grade 3-4 AEs than in those who did not suffer from AEs (median = 4852.0 versus 2464.9 ng.h.mL, P = 0.027). Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the AUC0-24 of lenalidomide was a good predictor of grade 3-4 AEs, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.758 (95% confidence interval, 0.572-0.943, P = 0.027). The cutoff value for best prediction of grade 3-4 AEs was 2613.5 ng.h.mL (sensitivity 86.7%, specificity 54.5%). Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed the significance of this cutoff value. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that overexposure to lenalidomide could contribute to toxicity. Furthermore, the predicted cutoff value of AUC0-24 can be clinically used to prevent severe AEs.
30127255	Dexamethasone	Hypertension	0	1	0	0		Maternal Resveratrol Therapy Protects Male Rat Offspring against Programmed Hypertension Induced by TCDD and Dexamethasone Exposures: Is It Relevant to Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor?	Hypertension can originate from early-life adverse environmental in utero exposure to dexamethasone (DEX) or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Since DEX and TCDD are related to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway, we examined whether resveratrol, an AHR modulator and antioxidant, could prevent programmed hypertension via regulating AHR signaling and oxidative stress. Groups of four-month-old male rat offspring were studied (n = 7(-)8 per group): control, DEX (0.1 mg/kg i.p. from a gestational age of 16 to 22 days), TCDD (200 ng/kg in four once-weekly oral doses), DEX + TCDD, and DEX + TCDD + R (resveratrol 0.05% in drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation). Maternal TCDD exposure aggravated prenatal DEX-induced hypertension in adult male offspring, which maternal resveratrol therapy prevented. Maternal TCDD exposure aggravated DEX-induced oxidative damage in offspring kidneys, which was prevented by resveratrol therapy. Maternal resveratrol therapy decreased asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA) levels, thereby preventing combined DEX and TCDD exposure-induced programmed hypertension. Increases in renal Ahrr and Cyp1a1 expression induced by DEX + TCDD exposure were restored by resveratrol therapy. The beneficial effects of resveratrol on DEX + TCDD-induced hypertension relate to reduced renal mRNA expression of Ren, Ace, and Agtr1a expression. Thus, the beneficial effects of resveratrol on DEX + TCDD-induced hypertension include reduction of oxidative stress, restoration of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, blockade of the renin(-)angiotensin system (RAS), and antagonizing AHR signaling pathway.

29680794	Risperidone	Cardiovascular Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Risperidone-associated sinus tachycardia potentiated by paliperidone palmitate in a patient with no prior cardiovascular disease: role of risperidone-related autonomic instability.	Risperidone and paliperidone palmitate are two antipsychotic drugs well tolerated in the management of schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions. There have been few reports of tachycardia induced by either drugs. Here, we report on a 21-year-old man, with a history of schizophrenia, and who developed persistent sinus tachycardia after he was restarted on risperidone, which later worsened after administration of paliperidone palmitate for long-term management. He had no cardiovascular risk factors other than obesity, and a prior well-tolerated risperidone treatment. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of patients developing sinus tachycardia due to autonomic instability from a prior risperidone treatment, even though overall, these drugs are well tolerated.
29412502	Metformin	Ovarian Neoplasms	1	0	0	0		The role of metformin and statins in the incidence of epithelial ovarian cancer in type 2 diabetes: a cohort and nested case-control study.	OBJECTIVE: To obtain evidence of the effects of metformin and statins on the incidence of ovarian cancer in women with type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study and nested case-control study. SETTING: The data were obtained from a diabetes database (FinDM) combining information from several nationwide registers. POPULATION: A cohort of 137 643 women over 40 years old and diagnosed with T2D during 1996-2011 in Finland. METHODS: In full cohort analysis Poisson regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) in relation to ever use of metformin, insulin other oral anti-diabetic medication or statins. In the nested case-control analysis 20 controls were matched to each case of ovarian cancer. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate HRs in relation to medication use and cumulative use of different medications. The estimates were adjusted for age and duration of T2D. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of ovarian cancer. RESULTS: In all, 303 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer during the follow up. Compared with other forms of oral anti-diabetic medication, metformin (HR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.72-1.45) was not found to be associated with the incidence of ovarian cancer. Neither was there evidence for statins to affect the incidence (HR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.78-1.25). In nested case-control analysis the results were essentially similar. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence of an association between the use of metformin or statins and the incidence of ovarian cancer in women with T2D was found. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: No evidence found for metformin or statins reducing the incidence of ovarian cancer.
29254817	Calcium Hydroxide	Tooth Fractures	0	0	0	0		The Effect of Long-term Dressing with Calcium Hydroxide on the Fracture Susceptibility of Teeth.	INTRODUCTION: Calcium hydroxide has been widely used to treat immature teeth to achieve periodontal healing and to promote the formation of an apical barrier. However, retrospective clinical studies have shown a high incidence of cervical root fractures with long-term calcium hydroxide dressing. The alkalinity of calcium hydroxide has been suggested to weaken the root. In vitro studies using ovine teeth show conflicting results on fracture strength of dentine, although different commercial products may have influenced the results. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 2 commercial products used in prior studies (Calasept Plus and UltraCal XS), as well as a new product (Calmix) that uses a nonaqueous vehicle that allows for a higher pH, on the fracture strength of dentine over time. METHODS: A total of 330 lamb incisor teeth were collected and the canals prepared so that 3 commercial calcium hydroxide products as well as a positive control of pure calcium hydroxide slurry that filled the root canal from the open apex and a negative control of saline was tested. The teeth were loaded until fracture with a universal testing machine at time points 0, 3, 6, and 9 months and the force to fracture was calculated. The data were analyzed with Friedman analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney t tests. RESULTS: No statistical differences were observed between the different calcium hydroxide products and the negative controls. CONCLUSIONS: Thin and fragile roots could be the cause of fracture rather than the calcium hydroxide dressing.
28849319	Thalidomide	Ectromelia	0	1	1	1		Robotic assisted radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer in thalidomide generation.	Thalidomide was used in the late 1950s and early 1960s as a sedative for morning sickness in pregnant women. It resulted in thousands of babies being born with various congenital anomalies, such as phocomelia. Subsequently, the drug was banned for this indication. Most of the survivors have become thalidomide adults and now they are in their fifties. We report the first case of a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in a 54-year-old male with prostate cancer and phocomelia as a result of thalidomide embryopathy. He presented with a PSA of 3.3 and was diagnosed with Gleason 3 + 4 prostate cancer. An extra peritoneal approach was chosen due to his body habitus and to avoid extreme Trendelenburg tilt. Side docking with the da Vinci robot was employed and the prostatectomy was carried out in the standard extra peritoneal fashion. At 6 months' follow-up his PSA is unrecordable and he is voiding well with minimal urinary incontinence, requiring 1 pad/day. We aim to outline our approach and highlight the technical modifications in this rare physically disabling condition.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of monotherapy with Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Sodium valproate (VPA) on serum 25-OH Vitamin D levels in children with epilepsy compared to controls. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Outpatient department of a tertiary-care Pediatric Neurology centre, and a nearby day-care centre and school. STUDY PERIOD: June 2012 to May 2013. PARTICIPANTS: Children with epilepsy aged 2 to 13 years on monotherapy with CBZ (n=28) or VPA (n=28) for at least 6 months; 109 age-matched controls from a nearby day-care centre and school. RESULTS: The median (IQR) values of 25 (OH) vitamin D was 18.0 ng/mL (13.7-27.3), 21.35 ng/mL (16.4 -25.2) and 30.5 ng/mL (19.1-43.7) in CBZ, VPA and control group, respectively (P= 0.008). 60.7% of patients in CBZ group and 35.7 % in VPA group had low 25 (OH) D levels (%20 ng/mL) compared to 27.8% in controls (P=0.001).The serum alkaline phosphatase level was higher in children on carbamazepine therapy (P=0.001) than controls. CONCLUSION: This study identifies significant risk of vitamin D deficiency in ambulant children with epilepsy on monotherapy with CBZ or VPA.

30301373	Polysorbates	Vomiting	1	1	0	0	0.0	Hypersensitivity and infusion-site adverse events with intravenous fosaprepitant after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy: a retrospective study.	AIM: Fosaprepitant, an intravenous neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, contains polysorbate 80, which is associated with infusion-site adverse events (ISAEs) and hypersensitivity systemic reactions (HSRs). This study investigated ISAEs/HSRs following fosaprepitant with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. PATIENTS & METHODS: This retrospective chart review noted ISAEs/HSRs following the anthracycline doxorubicin+cyclophosphamide and a three-drug fosaprepitant regimen, via peripheral line. RESULTS: 35/127 patients (28%) developed ISAEs/HSRs with chemotherapy and antiemetic therapy: 32 developed 137 individual ISAEs, primarily erythema, pain and catheter-site swelling; 16 developed 50 individual HSRs, primarily edema/swelling, erythema or dermatitis (no anaphylaxis). CONCLUSION: Fosaprepitant is associated with a significant ISAE/HSR rate following anthracycline-containing chemotherapy via peripheral line. Polysorbate 80-free intravenous neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist may provide a safer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting prophylaxis option.
30526658	Cyclophosphamide	Hyperglycemia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Difficult-to-diagnose diabetes in a patient treated with cyclophosphamide - the contradictory roles of immunosuppressant agents: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Cyclophosphamide may induce autoimmune diabetes through a decrease in suppressor T cells and increase of proinflammatory T helper type 1 response in animal models. In humans, this association is not as clear due to the presence of other risk factors for hyperglycemia, but it could be a precipitant for acute complications. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old Mestizo-Mexican woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with severe diabetic ketoacidosis, shortly after initiating a multi-drug immunosuppressive therapy. She did not meet the diagnostic criteria for type 1 or type 2 diabetes and had no family history of hyperglycemic states. She persisted with hyperglycemia and high insulin requirements until the discontinuation of cyclophosphamide. After this episode, she recovered her endogenous insulin production and the antidiabetic agents were successfully withdrawn. After 1 year of follow up she is still normoglycemic. CONCLUSION: Cyclophosphamide may be an additional risk factor for acute hyperglycemic crisis. Glucose monitoring could be recommended during and after this treatment.

Objectives: This meta-analysis aims to study the effects of atomoxetine and methylphenidate on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and a number of adverse cardiac events on patients receiving treatment for attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) in comparison to placebo and between atomoxetine and methylphenidate. Methods: We searched the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect. Meta-analysis was performed on studies that examined the relationships between methylphenidate or atomoxetine and HR, SBP, as well as a number of adverse cardiac events. These studies were either placebo-controlled or comparison studies between methylphenidate and atomoxetine. Meta-regression identified patient- and treatment-related factors that may contribute to heterogeneity. Results: Twenty-two studies were included and the total number of participants was 46,107. Children/adolescents and adults treated with methylphenidate had more significant increases in post- vs. pre-treatment HR (p < 0.001) and SBP (p < 0.001) than those treated by placebo. Children and adolescents treated with atomoxetine had more significant increases post- vs. pre-treatment HR (p = 0.025) and SBP (p < 0.001) than those treated with methylphenidate. Meta-regression revealed mean age of participants, mean dose, and duration of atomoxetine and methylphenidate as significant moderators that explained heterogeneity. There were no differences in the number of adverse cardiac events between participants with methylphenidate treatment and placebo or atomoxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Children/adolescents and adults treated with methylphenidate resulted in significant increases in post- vs. pre-treatment HR and SBP as compared to placebo. Similarly, children and adolescents treated with atomoxetine had significant increases in post- vs. pre-treatment HR and SBP than those treated with methylphenidate. These findings have potential implications for continuous monitoring of HR and SBP throughout the course of treatment although the risk for adverse cardiac events were insignificant.

The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is higher in patients with schizophrenia than in the general population. We aimed to investigate whether atypical antipsychotics (AAP) increase the levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), thereby increasing the risk of CVD. The data were from inpatients aged 18-60 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to ICD-10 at the Affiliated Brain Hospital of Nanjing Medical University who underwent physical examination between 1 October 2014 and 30 September 2016. A retrospective cohort study was used to analyse the correlation between AAP, Lp-PLA2 levels and the CVD risk (it was determined that Lp-PLA2 values >200 ng/mL were defined as high CVD risk) in patients treated with monotherapy, olanzapine, clozapine or quetiapine. Data were collected for 452 patients with eligible schizophrenia: 163 treated with clozapine, 186 treated with olanzapine, 47 treated with quetiapine and 56 receiving no medication. Compared with the no-medication patients, AAP administration in patients with olanzapine, clozapine or quetiapine had higher serum Lp-PLA2 levels when age, sex, BMI and fasting glucose level were matched. AAP were significantly associated with serum Lp-PLA2 level by Spearman's correlation coefficients. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that AAP administration was an independent factor of CVD risk when adjusted by potential confounding factors. This study is the first to confirm that AAP administration, especially clozapine and olanzapine, could increase Lp-PLA2 levels and CVD risk, independent of drug-induced weight gain in schizophrenia. The extent and the factors of increasing Lp-PLA2 level and CVD risk in olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine are discrepant. The possible effects of AAP on Lp-PLA2 in schizophrenia patients are involved in pro-inflammatory cytokines and hormones.

INTRODUCTION: Data are lacking regarding overdose of Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present the first report of suicidal attempt with E/C/F/TAF in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected subject. RESULTS: A reversible acute renal failure with no proximal tubulopathy and neuropsychiatric issues are discussed. E/C/F/TAF withdrawal resulted in favourable renal and neuropsychiatric outcomes. The suicide attempt seemed unrelated to the integrase strand transfer inhibitor, being evenly explained within the context of stressful personal conflicts. CONCLUSION: A suicidal attempt with an E/C/F/TAF overdose in an HIV-infected patient, resulted in a favourable outcome from a renal and neuropsychiatric standpoint.

30260467	Dexamethasone	Bipolar Disorder	1	1	0	0	0.0	[Mania Associated with the Use of Bortezomib and Dexamethasone].	Bortezomib, an antineoplastic agent used in Multiple Myeloma, is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid that is selectively and reversibly attached to the 26S proteasome. Bortezomib may be combined with corticosteroids in treatment-resistant multiple myeloma patients. Corticosteroids can cause many psychiatric disorders ncluding mania, depression, psychosis, delirium, suicide and aggression. To date only one case of mania associated with the use of bortezomib was reported in which the patient responded to the treatment with olanzapine and valproic acid. In this article, we present a 57-year-old female with multiple myeloma in whom mania developed after the use of bortezomib combined with dexamethasone.Psychiatric symptoms such as sleep deprivation, increased self-esteem and excessive speech appeared within the first week of bortezomib and dexamethasone treatment. Quetiapine was administered for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms. A gradual improvement was noted in manic symptoms after treatment. Bortezomib is a relatively new drug and there are only a few reports with respect to its psychiatric side effects. While using antineoplastic drugs such as bortezomib, caution should be exercised with regards to the psychiatric symptoms.
30080246	Tretinoin	Diarrhea	0	0	0	0		Effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in addition to chemotherapy for adults with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (non-acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non-APL)).	BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is the most common acute leukaemia affecting adults. Most patients diagnosed with AML are at advanced age and present with co-morbidities, so that intensive therapy such as stem cell transplantation (SCT) is impossible to provide or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment-related mortality. Especially for these patients, it is necessary to find out whether all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate of vitamin A inducing terminal differentiation of leukaemic cell lines, added to chemotherapy confers increased benefit or harm when compared with the same chemotherapy alone. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to determine benefits and harms of ATRA in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for adults with AML (not those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non-APL)). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, study registries and relevant conference proceedings up to July 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also contacted experts for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus ATRA in patients with all stages of AML. We excluded trials if less than 80% of participants were adults or participants with AML, and if no subgroup data were available. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included, if they had a refractory anaemia and more than 20% of blasts. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We used hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS; instead of the pre-planned event-free survival, as this outcome was not reported), and we calculated risk ratios (RR) for the other outcomes quality of life, on-study mortality and adverse events. We presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: Our search resulted in 2192 potentially relevant references, of which we included eight trials with 28 publications assessing 3998 patients. Overall, we judged the potential risk of bias of the eight included trials as moderate. Two of eight trials were published as abstracts only. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules and one trial only evaluated the effect of the hypomethylating agent decitabine, a drug know to affect epigenetics, in combination with ATRA.The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy resulted in probably little or no difference in OS compared to chemotherapy only (2985 participants; HR 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.02); moderate-certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate at 24 months of 70% with chemotherapy alone, the mortality rate with chemotherapy plus ATRA was 68% (95% CI 65% to 71%).For DFS, complete response rate (CRR) and on-study mortality there was probably little or no difference between treatment groups (DFS: 1258 participants, HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; CRR: 3081 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09; on-study mortality: 2839 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.30, all moderate-certainty evidence).Three trials with 1428 participants reported the adverse events 'infection' and 'cardiac toxicity': There was probably no, or little difference in terms of infection rate between participants receiving ATRA or not (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ATRA decreases cardiac toxicity (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90; P = 0.02, very low certainty-evidence, however, cardiac toxicity was low).Rates and severity of diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting were assessed in two trials with 337 patients and we are uncertain whether there is a difference between treatment arms (diarrhoea: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.47; nausea/vomiting: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.85; both very low-certainty evidence).Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence for a difference between participants receiving ATRA in addition to chemotherapy or chemotherapy only for the outcome OS. Regarding DFS, CRR and on-study mortality, there is probably no evidence for a difference between treatment groups. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events are comparable to chemotherapy only.As quality of life has not been evaluated in any of the included trials, further research is needed to clarify the effect of ATRA on quality of life.

Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoid malignancy representing 5% of all cancers in children, 16% in adolescents, and 30-40% of all malignant lymphomas and has a survival rate of ~95% at 10 years. One of the most common treatment schemes uses a cocktail of genotoxic agents including adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) with or without radiotherapy. We investigated the occurrence of chromosomal damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes from five patients diagnosed with HL who provided samples before (BT), during chemotherapy (DT) and ~1 year after ABVD chemotherapy/radiotherapy (AT). Five healthy subjects served as controls. Chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization. The average frequencies of structural chromosomal aberrations in HL samples were 0.11, 0.22, and 0.96 per cell in BT, DT, and AT samples, respectively. These frequencies were significantly different (P < 0.0001) with respect to control subjects (0.02 per cell). Interestingly, the highest frequency of structural damage, including genomic chaos and nonclonal abnormalities, was observed in the AT samples indicating that new aberrations were continuously produced. Rejoined structural chromosomal aberrations were the most common type of aberrations, although aneuploidies were also significantly increased. Finally, we found several chromosomal abnormalities linked to cancer secondary to treatment in all five HL patients. Our results show that ABVD chemotherapy plus radiotherapy is inducing genomic chaos in vivo; moreover, the persistence of genomic instability in the hematopoietic stem cells from HL patients may play a role in the occurrence of secondary cancer that is observed in 5-20% of HL patients.

One of the most common treatment schemes uses a cocktail of genotoxic agents including adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) with or without radiotherapy. We investigated the occurrence of chromosomal damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes from five patients diagnosed with HL who provided samples before (BT), during chemotherapy (DT) and ~1 year after ABVD chemotherapy/radiotherapy (AT). Five healthy subjects served as controls. Chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization. The average frequencies of structural chromosomal aberrations in HL samples were 0.11, 0.22, and 0.96 per cell in BT, DT, and AT samples, respectively. These frequencies were significantly different (P < 0.0001) with respect to control subjects (0.02 per cell). Interestingly, the highest frequency of structural damage, including genomic chaos and nonclonal abnormalities, was observed in the AT samples indicating that new aberrations were continuously produced. Rejoined structural chromosomal aberrations were the most common type of aberrations, although aneuploidies were also significantly increased. Finally, we found several chromosomal abnormalities linked to cancer secondary to treatment in all five HL patients. Our results show that ABVD chemotherapy plus radiotherapy is inducing genomic chaos in vivo; moreover, the persistence of genomic instability in the hematopoietic stem cells from HL patients may play a role in the occurrence of secondary cancer that is observed in 5-20% of HL patients.

29330715	Warfarin	Hemorrhage	1	1	0	0	0.0	Case Series Analysis of New Zealand Reports of Rapid Intense Potentiation of Warfarin by Roxithromycin.	INTRODUCTION: We undertook an analysis of all the reports to the New Zealand Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring of a roxithromycin/warfarin interaction after two recent reports described intense rapid warfarin potentiation. The interaction was first published in 1995. Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibition has been the proposed mechanism but has limited biologic plausibility. There are suggestions that the clinical significance of the interaction may be increased by severe illness, polypharmacy, renal dysfunction, older age and increased warfarin sensitivity. METHODS: To investigate the potentiating effect of warfarin on roxithromycin in this New Zealand case series, the reports were reviewed to identify patients at risk, compare the reporting pattern with published Australian data and evaluate the appropriateness of current prescribing advice. RESULTS: Thirty patient reports were identified. The age range was 23-88 years, mean 66.8, median 73.0 (standard deviation 17.7) and the international normalised ratios after roxithromycin commencement ranged from 3.6 to 16.7 (mean 7.6, median 7.6, standard deviation 3.6). For eight patients with measurements on day 3, international normalised ratios were 4.3-16.7 (mean 10.4, median 8.8, standard deviation 4.4). Four patients had serious haemorrhage. Indications for roxithromycin were a range of respiratory tract infections. Anticoagulation was stable for most patients prior to acute infection. Serious infection occurred in 54.5% (12 of 22 patients with information). Polypharmacy (five or more medicines daily) was used by 36.7% of patients long term, increasing acutely to 83.3%, including additional potentially interacting medicines. Warfarin daily dose (1.5-13.0 mg, mean 4.4, median 4.0, standard deviation 2.2) was moderate to low. Pre-roxithromycin international normalised ratio values ranged from 1.4 to 3.7, mean and median 2.5, standard deviation 0.5. A high proportion of interactions were observed between warfarin and roxithromycin compared with other macrolides and compared with cytochrome P450 3A4-related macrolide interactions. The pattern was similar to published Australian data. CONCLUSION: In this case series, the high prevalence of acute polypharmacy, including potentially interacting medicines, and serious infection suggests that they may have contributed to warfarin potentiation and increased the clinical significance of a roxithromycin/warfarin interaction.
29506852	Cisplatin	Liver Neoplasms	0	1	0	0		Chemotherapy can promote liver metastasis by enhancing metastatic niche formation in mice.	BACKGROUND: Some chemotherapeutic agents have been reported to promote lung metastasis. However, there have been no reports regarding chemotherapy-induced liver metastasis. We hypothesized that chemotherapy might also enhance liver metastasis. The present study aimed to create a chemotherapy-enhanced liver metastasis mouse model and investigate its mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were pretreated with cisplatin, vincristine, or saline by intraperitoneal injection. Next, B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cells were injected into the spleens of C57BL/6 and BALB/c nu/nu mice, respectively, to induce experimental liver metastasis, and the number of liver nodules was determined. We also analyzed the effect of chemotherapy on changes of the liver tissue regarding representative metastasis-promoting factors using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical and histological analysis. RESULTS: Cisplatin increased the number of nodules by 4.7-fold in the B16F10 liver metastasis model. Vincristine increased the number of nodules by 3.8-fold in the BE(2)-C liver metastasis model. Cisplatin increased mRNA levels of matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and periostin, while vincristine increased MMP-9 and S100A8/9 levels in liver tissues. Cisplatin induced fibrosis, whereas vincristine induced neutrophil recruitment in liver tissues according to histological and immunohistochemical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that cisplatin or vincristine could enhance liver metastasis of mouse melanoma cells or human neuroblastoma cells, respectively. In addition, the mRNA expression of MMP-2 and periostin, or MMP-9 and S100A8/9 is increased by cisplatin or vincristine pretreatment, possibly resulting in fibrosis or neutrophil recruitment, respectively. These niche factors might be associated with increased liver metastasis.

Venous thromboembolism and arterial ischemic events are the main deleterious diseases associated with the use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC). Even though their composition has been substantially improved, the vascular risk persists with the most recent CHCs use. If the vascular risk associated with CHCs containing 50mug EE is significantly higher than with those containing less than 50mug, there is no evidence that the CHCs containing either 30 or 20mug of EE induce different venous risks. CHC containing gestodene, desogestrel, drospirenone or cyproterone acetate are associated with a higher risk of venous thrombosis compared with levonorgestrel-containing CHCs. CHC containing norgestimate are associated with similar venous thrombosis risk than CHC containing levonorgestrel. Venous thrombosis risk of non-oral routes of administration of CHC appears to be equivalent to the risk of CHC containing gestodene or desogestrel, but this result is based on a small number of epidemiological studies. Before prescribing a CHC, it is important to determine all vascular risk factors. Family history of ischemic arterial event or venous thromboembolism disease should be routinely sought before any CHC prescription. All CHCs are contraindicated in women with biological thrombophilia, in women with combined vascular risk factors, in women with first-degree family history of arterial or venous event (under age 50) as well as in women suffering of migraine with aura. Progestin-only contraceptives are not associated with vascular risk (arterial or venous) outside of medroxyprogesterone acetate. In women with higher vascular risk, progestin-only contraceptives (administered by oral, sous-cutaneous or intra-uterine routes) can be prescribed.

29359414	Cadmium	Cleft Palate	1	1	0	0	0.0	Maternal occupational cadmium exposure and nonsyndromic orofacial clefts.	BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is a well-studied risk factor for orofacial clefts (OFCs). Little is known about which constituents in cigarette smoke contribute to this teratogenicity in humans. One constituent, cadmium, has been associated with OFCs in animal studies; in humans, the role of maternal cadmium exposure on OFCs, independent of cigarette smoke, is unclear. In particular, the relation between maternal occupational cadmium exposure and OFCs is largely unexplored. METHODS: Using data from a large, population-based case-control study, we compared expert rater assessed maternal occupational cadmium exposure from self-reported occupational histories during the period 1 month before through 3 months after conception between OFC cases (n = 1,185) and unaffected controls (n = 2,832). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals for any (yes/no) and cumulative (no, low, high exposure) occupational cadmium exposures and all OFCs, cleft lip +/- cleft palate (CL/P) and cleft palate (CP). RESULTS: Overall, 45 mothers (cases = 13, controls = 32) were rated as having occupational cadmium exposure. Comparing all OFCs to controls, we observed inverse, nonsignificant aORs for any or low exposure, and positive, nonsignificant aORs for high exposure. Where data were available, aORs for CL/P and CP tended to parallel those for all OFCs. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically examine maternal occupational cadmium exposure and OFCs, using expert rater exposure assessment. The small numbers of exposed mothers observed, however, led to imprecise estimates. Continued research using more detailed occupational exposure assessment and increased sample sizes is recommended.
29171003	Diazepam	Status Epilepticus	1	0	0	0		Inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase terminates diazepam-resistant status epilepticus in mice and its effects are potentiated by a ketogenic diet.	OBJECTIVE: Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening and commonly drug-refractory condition. Novel therapies are needed to rapidly terminate seizures to prevent mortality and morbidity. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is the key enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and a major contributor to the brain pool of arachidonic acid (AA). Inhibiting of monoacylglycerol lipase modulates synaptic activity and neuroinflammation, 2 mediators of excessive neuronal activation underlying seizures. We studied the effect of a potent and selective irreversible MAGL inhibitor, CPD-4645, on SE that was refractory to diazepam, its neuropathologic sequelae, and the mechanism underlying the drug's effects. METHODS: Diazepam-resistant SE was induced in adult mice fed with standard or ketogenic diet or in cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor knock-out mice. CPD-4645 (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or vehicle was dosed 1 and 7 h after status epilepticus onset in video-electroencephalography (EEG) recorded mice. At the end of SE, mice were examined in the novel object recognition test followed by neuronal cellloss analysis. RESULTS: CPD-4645 maximal plasma and brain concentrations were attained 0.5 h postinjection (half-life = 3.7 h) and elevated brain 2-AG levels by approximately 4-fold. CPD-4645 administered to standard diet-fed mice progressively reduced spike frequency during 3 h postinjection, thereby shortening SE duration by 47%. The drug immediately abrogated SE in ketogenic diet-fed mice. CPD-4645 rescued neuronal cell loss and cognitive deficit and reduced interleukin (IL)-1beta and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) brain expression resulting from SE. The CPD-4645 effect on SE was similar in mice lacking CB1 receptors. SIGNIFICANCE: MAGL represents a novel therapeutic target for treating status epilepticus and improving its sequelae. CPD-4645 therapeutic effects appear to be predominantly mediated by modulation of neuroinflammation.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the correlation between preparative solid food status and the incidence of nausea, vomiting and aspiration symptoms in contrast-enhanced CT examination, and to provide direction for standardizing the preparative dietary policies. METHODS: Patients who underwent routine enhanced CT examination at our hospital between June 2015 and June 2017 (110,836 cases) were enrolled and allocated into solid food fasting group (51,807 cases) and solid food non-fasting group (59,029 cases). Fluids ingestion was not restricted for any case. The differences in the incidence of nausea, vomiting and aspiration symptoms between the two groups of patients with various basic data were compared. The risk factors for the occurrence of nausea, vomiting and aspiration symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: The total incidence of nausea and vomiting was extremely low (0.071%), and no aspiration developed. There was no significant difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting between the two groups in all respects (p > 0.05). The incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients with an iodine adverse drug reaction (ADR) history was higher than those with other ADR history (p = 0.008) and those without ADR history (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of nausea and vomiting has no correlation with the preparative solid food status. Unless compulsory in clinical needs and constraints and gastrointestinal examination, solid food fasting is not a must in other examinations. Particular attention should be paid to the patients with an iodine ADR history in an effort to prevent possible ADRs. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The correlation between preparative solid food status and the incidence of nausea, vomiting and aspiration symptoms in contrast-enhanced CT examination were comprehensively analyzed in a large-scale population.

29515069	Dasatinib	Hypertension, Pulmonary	1	1	1	1	1.0	[Mixed connective tissue disease with pulmonary hypertension developing in a chronic myeloid leukemia patient on dasatinib treatment].	A 37-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Nilotinib treatment was initiated; however, it had to be discontinued due to an allergic reaction one month later, and dasatinib treatment was provided. Although favorable response was obtained, she started complaining of shortness of breath 7 months after initiating dasatinib treatment. Chest X-ray and echocardiography indicated pulmonary congestion and hypertension. Further, she was diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) based on Raynaud phenomenon, swollen fingers, sclerodactyly, pancytopenia, hypocomplementemia, and positive anti-U1-RNP antibody. Consequently, dasatinib treatment was discontinued, and she was administered prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), which was effective and successfully tapered with concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide. This is the first case of MCTD that developed during dasatinib treatment. However, because the present case was a young woman, the development of MCTD could probably be attributed to autoimmune diatheses or it may be a coincidence. However, the possibility of patients receiving dasatinib treatment developing autoimmune diseases needs to be assessed.

Aspartame (alpha-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine-o-methyl ester), an artificial sweetener, has been linked to behavioral and cognitive problems. Possible neurophysiological symptoms include learning problems, headache, seizure, migraines, irritable moods, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The consumption of aspartame, unlike dietary protein, can elevate the levels of phenylalanine and aspartic acid in the brain. These compounds can inhibit the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, which are known regulators of neurophysiological activity. Aspartame acts as a chemical stressor by elevating plasma cortisol levels and causing the production of excess free radicals. High cortisol levels and excess free radicals may increase the brains vulnerability to oxidative stress which may have adverse effects on neurobehavioral health. We reviewed studies linking neurophysiological symptoms to aspartame usage and conclude that aspartame may be responsible for adverse neurobehavioral health outcomes. Aspartame consumption needs to be approached with caution due to the possible effects on neurobehavioral health. Whether aspartame and its metabolites are safe for general consumption is still debatable due to a lack of consistent data. More research evaluating the neurobehavioral effects of aspartame are required.

30096703	Vemurafenib	Skin Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Possible immune adverse events as predictors of durable response to BRAF inhibitors in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma.	BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) and MEK inhibitors (MEKi) are among the cornerstones of metastatic melanoma therapy demonstrating excellent response rates with duration of 7-12 m. Long-term benefit from these agents was reported in patients with normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and less than three disease sites. However, a treatment-dependent marker for long-term efficacy is lacking. Data suggest that immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are associated with clinical benefit in patients treated with immunotherapy and that response to BRAF/MEK therapy may have an underlying immune mechanism. We hypothesised that AEs with an underlying immune mechanism may be associated with a durable response to targeted therapy. We retrospectively identified a cohort of 78 BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma patients treated with BRAFi or BRAFi + MEKi between November 2010 and November 2013. Four treatment-related AEs including vitiligo, uveitis, erythema nodosum and keratitis sicca were defined as irAEs of interest. Retrospective analysis of AEs in relationship to progression-free survival (PFS), disease burden and LDH levels was performed. Median PFS (mPFS) for all patients was 7.5 months with responses ongoing in eight patients as of April 2017. Ten patients were identified with the AEs defined previously. Cox regression analysis revealed a very strong association between those AEs and PFS; mPFS was 42.8 m in patients with at least one AE versus 6.1 m in those without an AE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.22, p = 0.002). This association was independent of LDH levels and disease burden (HR 0.24, p = 0.035). This analysis demonstrates a strong association between immune AEs and durable response to targeted therapy and may provide a treatment-related biomarker to estimate the outcome of therapy.

Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) may be markers of intracerebral bleeding risk in patients receiving antithrombotic drugs. This study aimed to analyze CMBs and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in patients taking aspirin or clopidogrel.This retrospective study included patients with ischemic cardiovascular disease administered 75 mg/day aspirin (n = 150) or clopidogrel (n = 150, matched for age and gender) for >1 year (Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, China, from July, 2010 to July, 2015). Patients underwent T2-weighted imaging, T1-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and enhanced T2*-weighted angiography (ESWAN) imaging (3.0-Tesla scanner). Baseline vascular risk factors for CMBs and macroscopic bleeding (MB) were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.The aspirin and clopidogrel groups did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics or prevalences of CMBs or MB. The odds of MB were higher in patients with CMBs than in patients without CMBs in both the aspirin (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 4.09, 1.93-8.68; P < .001) and clopidogrel (6.42, 2.83-14.57; P < .001) groups. The odds of WMHs were also higher in patients with CMBs in both the aspirin (3.28, 1.60-6.71; P = .001) and clopidogrel (4.09, 1.91-8.75; P < .001) groups. Patients receiving treatment for >5 years showed elevated risk of CMBs in the aspirin (0.17; 0.09-0.36; P < .001) and clopidogrel (0.15, 0.07-0.33; P < .001) groups as well as higher odds of MB in the aspirin (0.34, 0.16-0.71; P = .004) and clopidogrel (0.37, 0.17-0.80; P = .010) groups.The WMHs and MB were associated with CMBs in patients taking aspirin or clopidogrel for >1 year, and long-term use increased the risks of CMB and bleeding.

Polypharmacy increases the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Combining epidemiological studies with pharmacokinetic modeling, we detected and evaluated high-dimensional DDIs among 30 frequent drugs. Multidrug combinations that increased the risk of myopathy were identified in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and electronic medical record (EMR) databases by a mixture drug-count response model. CYP450 inhibition was estimated among the 30 drugs in the presence of 1 to 4 inhibitors using in vitro / in vivo extrapolation. Twenty-eight three-way and 43 four-way DDIs had significant myopathy risk in both databases and predicted increases in the area under the concentration-time curve ratio (AUCR) >2-fold. The high-dimensional DDI of omeprazole, fluconazole, and clonidine was associated with a 6.41-fold (FAERS) and 18.46-fold (EMR) increased risk of myopathy local false discovery rate (<0.005); the AUCR of omeprazole in this combination was 9.35. The combination of health record informatics and pharmacokinetic modeling is a powerful translational approach to detect high-dimensional DDIs.

30412107	Phenytoin	Hypothyroidism	1	1	0	1	1.0	Hypothyroidism induced by phenytoin and gabapentin: A Case Report.	RATIONALE: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are one of the causative drugs of drug-induced hypothyroidism. In most cases, AED-induced hypothyroidism is subclinical and indicated only by abnormalities of free thyroxine (T4) and/or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Severe symptomatic hypothyroidism following AEDs is rarely reported in the literature. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 75-year-old man experienced neurologic symptoms including memory impairment, ataxic gait, sensory polyneuropathy and myopathy, lethargy, and edema of the face and lower extremities. He had been administered phenytoin and gabapentin for the treatment of symptomatic traumatic epilepsy 8 years before. DIAGNOSES: The patient had low free T4 (0.21 ng/dL) and high TSH (113.2 muIU/mL), which indicated hypothyroidism. Negative thyroid-related autoantibody tests and the lack of goiter excluded the possibility of Hashimoto disease. Phenytoin and/or gabapentin were strongly suspected as causing his hypothyroidism. INTERVENTION: The patient was treated with replacement therapy (levothyroxine 25 mug/day). OUTCOMES: His symptoms markedly and promptly improved alongside continued antiepileptic therapy. LESSONS: In this case, the patient's hypothyroidism was assumed to result from different mechanisms of the 2 AEDs leading to thyroid hormone reduction. AEDs can not only cause asymptomatic thyroid hormone abnormalities but also clinically observable hypothyroidism. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the association between anticonvulsants and symptomatic hypothyroidism.

29363543	Prolactin	Adenocarcinoma	1	1	0	0	0.0	Antiestrogen Therapy Increases Plasticity and Cancer Stemness of Prolactin-Induced ERalpha(+) Mammary Carcinomas.	Although antiestrogen therapies are successful in many patients with estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ERalpha(+)) breast cancer, 25% to 40% fail to respond. Although multiple mechanisms underlie evasion of these treatments, including tumor heterogeneity and drug-resistant cancer stem cells (CSC), further investigations have been limited by the paucity of preclinical ERalpha(+) tumor models. Here, we examined a mouse model of prolactin-induced aggressive ERalpha(+) breast cancer, which mimics the epidemiologic link between prolactin exposure and increased risk for metastatic ERalpha(+) tumors. Like a subset of ERalpha(+) patient cancers, the prolactin-induced adenocarcinomas contained two major tumor subpopulations that expressed markers of normal luminal and basal epithelial cells. CSC activity was distributed equally across these two tumor subpopulations. Treatment with the selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD), ICI 182,780 (ICI), did not slow tumor growth, but induced adaptive responses in CSC activity, increased markers of plasticity including target gene reporters of Wnt/Notch signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and increased double-positive (K8/K5) cells. In primary tumorsphere cultures, ICI stimulated CSC self-renewal and was able to overcome the dependence of self-renewal upon Wnt or Notch signaling individually, but not together. Our findings demonstrate that treatment of aggressive mixed lineage ERalpha(+) breast cancers with a SERD does not inhibit growth, but rather evokes tumor cell plasticity and regenerative CSC activity, predicting likely negative impacts on patient tumors with these characteristics.Significance: This study suggests that treatment of a subset of ERalpha(+) breast cancers with antiestrogen therapies may not only fail to slow growth but also promote aggressive behavior by evoking tumor cell plasticity and regenerative CSC activity.

29117788	Phenobarbital	Hypothermia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Recurrent Admissions for Hypothermia From Concomitant Topiramate and Phenobarbital: A Case Report.	INTRODUCTION: This article presents an additional case of concomitant topiramate and phenobarbital administration that resulted in 8 hospital admissions for hypothermia that resolved after discontinuation of phenobarbital. CASE: A 56-year-old white female with cerebral palsy and quadriplegia, epilepsy, and hypothyroidism was admitted to a community teaching hospital multiple times with documented hypothermia. These admissions followed a subsequent dose increase of topiramate in December 2014. In February 2015, the patient was admitted with 35 degrees C rectal temperature. Her 2 admissions in April were for hypothermia with temperatures of 34.6 degrees C and 33.6 degrees C, respectively. The patient had 5 other admissions with hypothermia through December 2015. All other causes of hypothermia were ruled out. The hypothermia resolved when phenobarbital was discontinued. DISCUSSION: A recent case series noted an association between phenobarbital and topiramate causing hypothermia. The patient's hypothermia developed while on concomitant phenobarbital and topiramate but only after an increase in topiramate. No other causes for hypothermia were found based upon physical examination or lab work. The Naranjo nomogram noted a probable causation. CONCLUSION: This case report points to an association of hypothermia with concomitant topiramate and phenobarbital with resolution after phenobarbital discontinuation. Improvement after discontinuation of phenobarbital seems to support a drug-effect relationship.
29957476	Aripiprazole	Pregnancy Complications	1	1	0	0	0.0	Aripiprazole and pregnancy: A retrospective, multicentre study.	BACKGROUND: Aripiprazole is a second generation antipsychotic medication that has been a useful addition to the treatment of severe mental illness due to its low metabolic and sedation risk profile. Pregnancy is a time of high risk of metabolic complications such as gestational diabetes and the postpartum period is often a time when sedation can compromise infant care. To date there is limited data in pregnancy on the safety of aripiprazole use. While available data do not suggest an elevated malformation risk in pregnancy, there is less information available on pregnancy and neonatal complications. METHODS: This study presents preliminary data on pregnancy and neonatal complications on 26 women who took aripiprazole in pregnancy. These women attended at antenatal clinics for women with severe mental illness at two hospitals in Australia. RESULTS: Overall aripiprazole was not associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes. However, use of aripiprazole in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of pregnancy hypertension, lower birth weight, shorter gestation at birth and higher rates of admission of the neonate than the expected population rates. LIMITATIONS: These findings need to be replicated in a larger, well-designed study to ensure they do not reflect confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that aripiprazole is unlikely to pose a metabolic risk in pregnancy but other pregnancy complications including hypertension, need to be examined in further studies.
30059880	Formaldehyde	Asthma	0	1	0	0		Exposure to formaldehyde and diisononyl phthalate exacerbate neuroinflammation through NF-kappaB activation in a mouse asthma model.	Diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and formaldehyde both are associated with asthma and allergies. However, it is unclear about the adverse effect of DINP and formaldehyde exposure on the brain for asthma patients. Here, we determined the effect of DINP and/or formaldehyde exposure on neuroinflammation in brain by a murine asthma model and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Mice were exposed to formaldehyde and/or DINP and sensitization with ovalbumin. The results show that exposure to formaldehyde and/or DINP not only exacerbated allergic asthma-like symptoms, but also promoted neuroinflammation in brain. The incrassation of the airway wall and exacerbation of neuroinflammation were more obviously when mice were subjected to a combined exposure to DINP and formaldehyde. Exposure to DINP and/or formaldehyde enhances oxidative stress and the activation of NF-kappaB in the prefrontal cortex of mouse asthma model. Exposure to DINP and/or formaldehyde also induced an increase in IL-1beta, IL-17, and NGF. Blocking oxidative stress by administering melatonin or inhibiting NF-kappaB activation by treatment with Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin effectively prevented increasing the levels IL-1beta, IL-17 and nerve growth factor. The data indicated that DINP and/or formaldehyde exposure promoted neuroinflammation in the brain through enhanced oxidative stress and activation of NF-kappaB in a mouse asthma model.
30176620	Nivolumab	Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1	1	1	0	0	1.0	Acute-onset diabetes mellitus with ketoacidosis in a nivolumab-treated patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.	The therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Programmed cell death-1 and programmed cell death-ligand-1 inhibitors) is a novel and promising approach in cancer treatment. The mode of action can cause serious adverse advents, mainly immune-related ones. The case of a 65 year old caucasian female is reported. She suffers from hepatocellular carcinoma since 2012. She underwent several surgeries, was treated with sorafenib and had transcatheter arterial chemoembolizations. As part of an individual healing trial, the patient was treated with nivolumab every 2 or 3 weeks since September 2017 and has no recurrence of the tumor ever since. Eight months after onset of the therapy she rapidly developed an insulin-dependent diabetes with ketoacidosis. She had no previous history of diabetes. She had no type 1 diabetes-related autoantibodies or a common HLA-genotype associated with a higher risk to develop type 1 diabetes mellitus. This adverse event during therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is yet reported to be rare. Cases with a rapid-onset diabetes with ketoacidosis have also been reported under treatment with other immune checkpoint inhibitors. The pathomechanism is not clear yet and which patients are at an elevated risk. An increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy can be expected. This may cause a concurrent increase of the side effect diabetes. Glucose monitoring and sensitizing the patients for this adverse event seems reasonable.

BACKGROUND: Among opioid-exposed infants, psychiatric medication co-exposure is common. Our objective was to compare Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) outcomes based on individual psychiatric medication co-exposures. METHODS: A retrospective study of 744 opioid-exposed mother-infant dyads from a single institution was performed. Mothers on pharmacotherapy with methadone or buprenorphine at delivery were included. Data were collected on maternal demographics, psychiatric medication use, and NAS outcomes, including any medication treatment, adjunctive medication treatment, length of hospital stay (LOS), and opioid treatment days. The extent to which individual psychiatric medication and polypharmacy exposure were associated with NAS outcomes was assessed using multivariable regression. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent of the mothers were on >/=1 psychiatric medication, with 32% on >/=2 or psychiatric medications (polypharmacy group). In adjusted models, polypharmacy exposure was associated with longer LOS (beta = 4.31 days, 95% CI 2.55-6.06) and opioid treatment days (beta = 3.98 days, 95% CI 2.24-5.72) and more treatment with adjunctive medication for NAS (aOR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.57-3.95). Benzodiazepines were associated with longer LOS (beta = 4.94, 95% CI 2.86-7.03) and opioid treatment days (beta = 4.86, 95% CI 2.61-6.75), and more adjunctive medication treatment (aOR = 2.57, 95% CI 1.49-4.42). Gabapentin was associated with longer LOS (beta = 2.79, 95% CI 0.54-5.03), more NAS medication treatment (aOR = 2.96, 95% CI 1.18-7.42) including more adjunctive medications (aOR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.05-3.53). CONCLUSION: For infants of mothers with OUD who are also on concurrent psychiatric medications, polypharmacy was associated with worse NAS severity. When medically indicated, limiting use of multiple psychiatric medications, particularly benzodiazepines and gabapentin, during pregnancy should be considered to improve NAS outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between type of antiresorptive medication and medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) onset and the role of premedication dental evaluation (PMDE) in the prevention of MRONJ. STUDY DESIGN: Our database of patients with MRONJ was reviewed. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the onset dose of the 3 frequent medication types associated with MRONJ. To evaluate the role of PMDE in the prevention of MRONJ, all patients on antiresorptive and/or antiangiogenic medications seen in the Dental Service of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center during a 10-year period were subclassified into 2 groups. Group I comprised patients seen for PMDE before the commencement of A/A and group II patients seen after prior exposure to antiresorptive and/or antiangiogenic medications. Fischer's exact test was used to compare the incidence of MRONJ in both groups. RESULTS: Patients on denosumab developed MRONJ earlier compared with zoledronate and pamidronate (P = .003). Group I had a significantly reduced incidence of MRONJ (0.9%) compared with group II (10.5%) (P < .0001). Dentoalveolar trauma as a precipitating factor between groups I and II was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab was associated with an earlier occurrence of MRONJ compared with zoledronate and pamidronate. The role of PMDE may be an effective preventive strategy in reducing the incidence of MRONJ.

High-dose loperamide is often used for the acute management of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, with a maximum daily dosing of up to 24 mg. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that loperamide can cause rare serious cardiac events, including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, cardiac arrest and death. Most events were reported in patients taking very high doses for an extended period of time. Daily intake ranged from 64 mg to 1600 mg, often continuously for weeks or months. In addition, the reported serum levels of loperamide ranged from 22 ng/mL to 210 ng/mL, which is likely significantly higher than that expected from patients taking the recommended doses for chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Overall, the incidence of serious cardiac events associated with loperamide remains low. In balance, the risk of uncontrolled complications from chemotherapy-induced diarrhea is likely greater than the rare cardiac risk associated with the chronic misuse of much higher doses of loperamide.

Six dogs were diagnosed with punctal stenosis following the long-term use of topical neomycin-polymyxin B-dexamethasone (NPD). All patients were initially presented for ophthalmic diseases requiring ongoing anti-inflammatory therapy. Five of the 6 dogs had previously or concurrently been treated with topical anti-inflammatory medications other than NPD. One patient exclusively received topical NPD prior to the diagnosis of punctal stenosis. The onset of punctal stenosis following therapy with NPD was variable among patients, ranging from 4 months to over 1 year. Diagnosis of punctal stenosis was made based upon the presence of epiphora and visualization of fibrotic tissue over the nasolacrimal puncta.

29771164	Ascorbic Acid	Nausea	0	0	0	0		Retrospective Evaluation of Clinical Experience With Intravenous Ascorbic Acid in Patients With Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Intravenous ascorbic acid (IV AA) has been used extensively in cancer patients throughout the United States. Currently, there are limited data on the safety and clinical effects of IV AA. The purpose of this study was to expand the current literature using a retrospective analysis of adverse events and symptomatic changes of IV AA in a large sample of cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients receiving IV AA for cancer at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital over a 7-year period. We assessed all reports of adverse events, laboratory findings, and hospital or emergency department admissions. We also reviewed quality-of-life data, including fatigue, nausea, pain, appetite, and mood. RESULTS: There were 86 patients who received a total of 3034 doses of IV AA ranging from 50 to 150g. In all, 32 patients received only ascorbic acid as part of their cancer management (1197 doses), whereas 54 patients received ascorbic acid in conjunction with chemotherapy (1837 doses). The most common adverse events related to ascorbic acid were temporary nausea and discomfort at the injection site. All events reported in the ascorbic acid alone group were associated with less than 3% of the total number of infusions. Patients, overall, reported improvements in fatigue, pain, and mood while receiving ascorbic acid. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis support the growing evidence that IV AA is generally safe and well tolerated in patients with cancer, and may be useful in symptom management and improving quality of life.

The widespread use of dopaminergic agents for the treatment of Parkinson's disease has revealed the presence of gambling disorder (GD) as an uncommon, but serious, adverse reaction to these agents. We describe the main characteristics of drug-induced GD reports received by the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System during the period from 1983 to 2016. Fifteen reports of GD have been identified. Dopaminergic agonists, especially pramipexole, are the main drugs involved in inducing GD. Physicians prescribing these drugs should warn patients and families about this disorder. Knowledge of this disorder will encourage early diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of this clinically and socially relevant disorder.
29304236	Dexamethasone	Spinal Fractures	1	1	0	0	0.0	The Effect of Epidural Steroid Injections on Bone Mineral Density and Vertebral Fracture Risk: A Systematic Review and Critical Appraisal of Current Literature.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to review the available literature investigating the effect of epidural steroid injections (ESIs) on bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral fracture risk. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review of current literature. METHODS: The sources of the data were PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus. Papers included in the review were original research articles in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: A total of 7,233 patients (eight studies) with a mean age ranging between 49 and 74 years and an average follow-up between six and 60 months were studied. Steroids that were used included triamcinolone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone (MP), with a mean number of injections ranging from one to 14.7 and an average cumulative dose in MP equivalents between 80 and 8,130 mg. Epidural steroids were associated with significantly decreased BMD in four out of six included studies, and with increased risk of vertebral fracture in one out of two included studies. Significant reductions in BMD were associated with a cumulative MP dose of 200 mg over a one-year period and 400 mg over three years, but not in doses of less than 200 mg of MP equivalents for postmenopausal women and at least 3 g for healthy men. The risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis was lower in patients who were receiving anti-osteoporotic medication during the treatment course. CONCLUSIONS: ESIs should be recommended with caution, especially in patients at risk for osteoporotic fractures, such as women of postmenopausal age. Anti-osteoporotic medication might be considered prior to ESI.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Toxic prolongation of the QRS interval most often results from blockade of cardiac voltage-gated sodium channels and manifests on electrocardiogram with a right bundle-branch block-like morphology. Rarely, a left bundle-branch block (LBBB) morphology has been reported. CASE REPORT: We report a case of transient LBBB resultant from ingestion of lamotrigine and citalopram which was refractory to sodium bicarbonate therapy and eventually resolved spontaneously. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Cases of toxic LBBB are less likely to respond to bicarbonate therapy, suggesting that this finding is due to a mechanism other than sodium channel blockade.

30275022	Furosemide	Dehydration	1	0	0	0		Hypoxic hepatitis and furosemide.	Hypoxic hepatitis is a rather common complication of heart, circulatory or respiratory failure. We present the case of a patient with hypoxic hepatitis in the setting of heart failure and dehydration from furosemide as a reminder of an important clinical lesson. The pathogenesis of hypoxia (especially in the case of heart failure) is explained by a two-hit mechanism in which the liver at risk of hypoxic injury by passive hepatic congestion (right heart failure) is subsequently exposed to systemic hypoperfusion, which leads to a marked and transient elevation of aminotransferases. In the case presented, the use of furosemide (at least partially) promoted the second hit because it helped to generate hypotension and splanchnic hypovolaemia and favoured hepatic hypoxia.

We present a case report of an early-onset drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome) induced by vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) in a middle-age man affected by a metastatic, BRAF mutant melanoma who was started on first-line metastatic treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib.After initiating the treatment, the patient presented an extensive cutaneous rash with eosinophilia and renal impairment. Due the constellation of signs and symptoms, a diagnosis of DRESS syndrome was made which strongly contraindicated the reintroduction of vemurafenib due to its hypersensibility reaction. Thus, vemurafenib was stopped immediately, and we started corticoid treatment with clinical improvement.Due to the contraindication to start vemurafenib again, after multidisciplinary view of the case and having balanced the risks and benefits, we successfully performed a switch to another BRAF inhibitor in a progressively ascending pattern, without any skin toxicity and with a good response of the metastatic melanoma.

BACKGROUND: This systematic review assesses effects of paternal exposure to dermatologic medications by using the former US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy categories as a benchmark. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether systemic dermatologic medications can cause infertility and teratogenicity when taken by men. METHODS: Categories D and X dermatologic medications were identified; a systematic review of the literature and reviews of the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System and prescribing information were performed to identify the effects of these medications on male fertility and teratogenicity. A secondary search was performed to assess for other systemic dermatologic medications causing teratogenicity or infertility following paternal exposure. RESULTS: A total of 13 medications met the inclusion criteria. Of 1,032 studies identified, 19 were included after a systematic review of the literature. Studies evaluating medication effects with paternal exposure were identified for 10 of the 13 evaluated medications, and evidence of a negative effect was identified for 6 medications. LIMITATIONS: We did not encounter any studies for 3 medications that met the inclusion criteria. Information submitted to the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System may not reflect the incidence of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Many former pregnancy category D and X systemic dermatologic medications also have effects on male fertility. More research and better-quality studies are required in this area, particularly studies assessing potential teratogenicity.

28921303	Carboplatin	Alopecia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Registry study to assess hair loss prevention with the Penguin Cold Cap in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.	PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a distressing side effect of cancer treatment. The aim of this registry study was to assess efficacy and tolerability of scalp hypothermia using Penguin Cold Caps (Penguin) in breast cancer patients. METHODS: Hair loss was assessed by patients using a 100-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and by physicians using the 5-point Dean Scale at baseline, every 3-4 weeks during chemotherapy, and at least 1 month after completion of chemotherapy. The primary efficacy endpoint for success was defined as </=50% hair loss by patient report (VAS) at follow-up (FUP). Tolerability and satisfaction were assessed by patient report. RESULTS: 103 patients enrolled between 7/2010 and 6/2015; 97 are evaluable for the primary endpoint. Chemotherapy included docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (TC; n = 50) for 4-6 cycles every 3 weeks, weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks then doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (P/AC; n = 23) for 4 cycles every 2-3 weeks, AC then paclitaxel (AC/P; n = 10), docetaxel/carboplatin +/- trastuzumab (TCH; n = 4) for 4-6 cycles every 3 weeks. Overall, 61% of patients successfully prevented CIA; impact was regimen specific: TCH 100%, TC x 4 84%, TC x 5-6 50%, P/AC 43%, AC/P 20%. The most common toxicity was headache, reported by 78.5% of patients with mean pain level 37/100. Satisfaction among those who completed scalp cooling (SC) and FUP ranged from 74 to 100%. All patients who completed SC/FUP recommended Penguin. CONCLUSIONS: Scalp hypothermia with Penguin is effective in reducing alopecia, particularly for non-anthracycline-based shorter regimens. Penguin was well tolerated and viewed favorably by most patients.

29722073	Acetaminophen	Acidosis, Renal Tubular	1	1	0	0	0.0	Complications related to chronic supratherapeutic use of codeine containing compound analgesics in a cohort of patients presenting for codeine withdrawal.	INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: This study aimed to compare complications arising due to the supratherapeutic use of paracetamol/codeine or ibuprofen/codeine containing compound analgesics in primary codeine-dependent patients presenting to a drug and alcohol withdrawal service. Data was compared to determine if there was any difference in the number of complications observed between the two groups. DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective case review of patients presenting for primary codeine dependence from 2009 to 2014. Sixty patients (42F, 36 +/- 10 years) using ibuprofen/codeine and 46 (26F, 39 +/- 10 years) using paracetamol/codeine containing compound analgesics were compared. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Patients consumed similar daily doses of codeine (699 +/- 45 vs. 636 +/- 50 mg) with those consuming ibuprofen/codeine containing compound analgesics ingesting twice as many tablets daily (median 60 vs. 30 tablets; P < 0.0001). Complications related to supratherapeutic use of codeine containing compound analgesics occurred more commonly in patients taking ibuprofen/codeine (52/60; 87%) versus paracetamol/codeine compound analgesics (30/46; 65%) (P < 0.01). Patients taking ibuprofen/codeine containing compound analgesics were more likely to have gastrointestinal bleeding (P < 0.05), anaemia (P < 0.0001) and renal tubular acidosis (P < 0.05). There were two deaths in the group abusing ibuprofen/codeine compound analgesics. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In patients with primary codeine dependence, there were more complications related to the supratherapeutic use of ibuprofen/codeine versus paracetamol/codeine containing compound analgesics. The patients in both groups ingested similar total daily codeine amounts. Increased daily tablet intake in the ibuprofen/codeine group could possibly have been linked to lower codeine content per tablet.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In patients with primary codeine dependence, there were more complications related to the supratherapeutic use of ibuprofen/codeine versus paracetamol/codeine containing compound analgesics. The patients in both groups ingested similar total daily codeine amounts. Increased daily tablet intake in the ibuprofen/codeine group could possibly have been linked to lower codeine content per tablet.

INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: This study aimed to compare complications arising due to the supratherapeutic use of paracetamol/codeine or ibuprofen/codeine containing compound analgesics in primary codeine-dependent patients presenting to a drug and alcohol withdrawal service. Data was compared to determine if there was any difference in the number of complications observed between the two groups. DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective case review of patients presenting for primary codeine dependence from 2009 to 2014. Sixty patients (42F, 36 +/- 10 years) using ibuprofen/codeine and 46 (26F, 39 +/- 10 years) using paracetamol/codeine containing compound analgesics were compared. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Patients consumed similar daily doses of codeine (699 +/- 45 vs. 636 +/- 50 mg) with those consuming ibuprofen/codeine containing compound analgesics ingesting twice as many tablets daily (median 60 vs. 30 tablets; P < 0.0001). Complications related to supratherapeutic use of codeine containing compound analgesics occurred more commonly in patients taking ibuprofen/codeine (52/60; 87%) versus paracetamol/codeine compound analgesics (30/46; 65%) (P < 0.01). Patients taking ibuprofen/codeine containing compound analgesics were more likely to have gastrointestinal bleeding (P < 0.05), anaemia (P < 0.0001) and renal tubular acidosis (P < 0.05).

Combination therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) has been associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with monotherapy with either agent. This retrospective, matched cohort study was conducted to assess the comparative incidence of AKI due to combination therapy in patients receiving vancomycin and TZP in combination or as monotherapy. Patients aged >/=18 years admitted to Albany Medical Center (Albany, NY) between September 2013 and August 2014 who had received therapy for at least two consecutive days were included. Patients who were pregnant, neutropenic, had AKI on admission or with cystic fibrosis were excluded. Patients were matched on baseline risk of AKI. The main outcome of interest was AKI, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of >/=0.3 mg/L or >/=50% within 48 h. Secondary outcomes evaluated were length of hospital and ICU stay and inpatient mortality associated with AKI. The risk of AKI was 7.0%, 8.5% and 26.8% in the vancomycin monotherapy, TZP monotherapy and combination groups, respectively (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, combination therapy was independently associated with an increased odds of AKI (adjusted odds ratio = 4.406, 95% confidence interval 1.472-13.188) compared with vancomycin monotherapy. The excess risk of combination therapy was 11.3%. In this matched cohort study, there was an increased incidence of AKI in patients receiving vancomycin and TZP combination therapy. Further research is needed to determine the individual strategies to best prevent inpatient AKI in patients receiving this combination therapy.

29488615	Sucrose	Hypertension	0	0	0	0		High sucrose/fat diet and isosorbide mononitrate increase insulin resistance, nitric oxide production and myocardial apoptosis in a hypertensive rat model.	The present study aimed to investigate the association between insulin resistance (IR), nitric oxide (NO) production and myocardial apoptosis in a background of coexisting hypertension in a rodent animal model. A hypertensive rat model was established by feeding Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with a high sucrose/fat (HSF) diet for 12 weeks, in conjunction with isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN). Increased IR, NO content, apoptotic gene and protein expression, and morphological alterations within rat myocardium were evaluated. Following a total of 12 weeks of feeding with HSF and ISMN resulted in increased IR and NO content within the myocardial tissue of Wistar and SHR rats. HSF and ISMN activated myocardial apoptosis by downregulating the gene transcription and protein expression levels of the anti‑apoptotic B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2), and increasing the pro‑apoptotic Bcl‑2 associated X protein. Apoptosis was demonstrated by DNA fragmentation in terminal deoxynucleotidyl‑transferase‑mediated dUTP nick end labelling assay. In all experiments, the combination of HSF and ISMN was associated with more pronounced effects, indicating the possible synergistic effects. In addition, the correlation analysis in the Wistar rats fed with HSF only, revealed a positive association between NO production and IR. The results of the present study indicated that HSF and ISMN simultaneously increased IR, NO production and myocardial apoptosis in the hypertensive rat model, and may therefore contribute to investigations into the long‑term clinical use of ISMN in hypertensive patients.
29953514	Fentanyl	Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting	1	0	0	0		Association of nefopam use with postoperative nausea and vomiting in gynecological patients receiving prophylactic ramosetron: A retrospective study.	BACKGROUND: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common adverse effect of opioid-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA). Nefopam has been considered as a good candidate for inclusion in multimodal analgesia because of its opioid sparing effect, but it can be emetic. This study aims to examine whether the use of nefopam combined with fentanyl in IV PCA was associated with the higher incidence of PONV in patients receiving prophylactic ramosetron after gynecological surgery. METHODS: Data from 296 patients who underwent gynecological surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The patients received IV PCA containing either fentanyl 1500 mug and ketorolac 90 mg (Group K) or fentanyl 1500 mug and nefopam 80 mg (Group N). All patients in both groups received 0.3 mg of ramosetron at the end of surgery. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of PONV during the 3-day postoperative period. RESULTS: No difference was observed in the incidence of PONV during the 3-day postoperative period between the two groups. However, the incidence of nausea on postoperative day 2 was significantly higher in Group N (10.3%) than in Group K (2.8%) (P = 0.016). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the use of nefopam was not associated with a higher incidence of PONV (adjusted odds ratio, 1.616; 95% confidence interval, 0.952-2.743, P = 0.076). There were no differences in postoperative pain scores between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The combined use of nefopam with fentanyl in IV PCA was not associated with the higher incidence of PONV compared with the use of ketorolac and fentanyl combination in patients who received ramosetron as PONV prophylactic agent. However, prospective trials are required for a confirmative conclusion.

30406128	Azithromycin	Long QT Syndrome	1	1	0	0	0.0	Risk Evaluation of Azithromycin-Induced QT Prolongation in Real-World Practice.	BACKGROUND: Azithromycin exposure has been reported to increase the risk of QT prolongation and cardiovascular death. However, findings on the association between azithromycin and cardiovascular death are controversial, and azithromycin is still used in actual practice. Additionally, quantitative assessments of risk have not been performed, including the risk of QT prolongation when patients are exposed to azithromycin in a real-world clinical setting. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the risk of exposure to azithromycin on QT prolongation in a real-world clinical setting using a 21-year medical history database of a tertiary medical institution. METHODS: We analyzed the electrocardiogram results and relevant electronic health records of 402,607 subjects in a tertiary teaching hospital in Korea from 1996 to 2015. To evaluate the risk of QT prolongation of azithromycin, we conducted a case-control analysis using amoxicillin for comparison. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to correct for age, sex, accompanying drugs, and disease. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) for QT prolongation (QTc>450 ms in male and >460 ms in female) on azithromycin exposure was 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.59), and the OR for severe QT prolongation (QTc>500 ms) was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13-1.82). On the other hand, the ORs on exposure to amoxicillin were 1.06 (95% CI, 0.97-1.15) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.70-1.09). In a subgroup analysis, the risk of QT prolongation in patients aged between 60 and 80 years was significantly higher when they are exposed to azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of QT prolongation was increased when patients, particularly the elderly aged 60-79 years, were exposed to azithromycin. Therefore, clinicians should pay exercise caution using azithromycin or consider using other antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, instead of azithromycin.

PURPOSE: The case of a patient who experienced bone marrow edema and pain in both feet and a compression fracture of one heel bone after several months of everolimus use is reported. SUMMARY: A 62-year-old woman with a grade 1 metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET) developed bilateral lower extremity edema and pain approximately 4 months after initiation of treatment with everolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR). The patient was referred for orthopedic evaluation, which resulted in diagnosis of bone marrow edema and a compression fracture of the calcaneus on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging results. The case was discussed with a clinical pharmacist, and after an in-depth analysis to rule out potential alternative causes for the patient's edema and pain, everolimus was discontinued. The patient had a full recovery from the presenting symptoms within 10 days of discontinuation of everolimus. Analysis of this case using the adverse drug reaction probability scale of Naranjo et al. yielded a score of 6, indicating a probable adverse reaction to everolimus. A hypothesized mechanism for everolimus-induced bone pain includes marrow edema and hyperemia from reduced intraosseous perfusion, which have been previously reported in association with mTOR inhibitor use. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow edema developed and a fracture occurred in a patient taking everolimus for a metastatic pNET, with complete resolution of lower extremity swelling and pain within 2 weeks of everolimus discontinuation.

Dapsone has been part of the World Health Organization multidrug therapy for the treatment of leprosy. While it has been efficacious in the management of leprosy, there are many patients who develop adverse drug reactions to the drug including life-threatening reactions such as dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (DHS). We report a case of a patient who was prescribed dapsone as part of multidrug therapy for leprosy following which she developed DHS. Her condition worsened after tapering the oral steroids given to manage the DHS, and she was detected to have hypothyroidism. She developed diabetes mellitus and succumbed to septic shock.
29648420	Pyrethrins	Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects	0	1	0	0		Prenatal Exposure to DDT and Pyrethroids for Malaria Control and Child Neurodevelopment: The VHEMBE Cohort, South Africa.	BACKGROUND: Although indoor residual spraying (IRS) with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroids effectively controls malaria, it potentially increases human exposure to these insecticides. Previous studies suggest that prenatal exposure to these insecticides may impact human neurodevelopment. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate the effects of maternal insecticide exposure and neurodevelopment of toddlers living in a malaria-endemic region currently using IRS. METHODS: The Venda Health Examination of Mothers, Babies and their Environment (VHEMBE) is a birth cohort of 752 mother-child pairs in Limpopo, South Africa. We measured maternal exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), in maternal serum, and measured pyrethroid metabolites in maternal urine. We assessed children's neurodevelopment at 1 and 2 y of age using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, third edition (BSID-III), and examined associations with maternal exposure. RESULTS: DDT and DDE were not associated with significantly lower scores for any BSID-III scale. In contrast, each 10-fold increase in cis-DCCA, trans-DCCA, and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid were associated, respectively, with a -0.63 (95% CI: -1.14, -0.12), -0.48 (95% CI: -0.92, -0.05), and -0.58 (-1.11, -0.06) decrement in Social-Emotional scores at 1 y of age. In addition, each 10-fold increase in maternal cis-DBCA levels was associated with significant decrements at 2 y of age in Language Composite scores and Expressive Communication scores [beta=-1.74 (95% CI: -3.34, -0.13) and beta=-0.40 (95% CI: -0.77, -0.04), respectively, for a 10-fold increase]. Significant differences by sex were estimated for pyrethroid metabolites and motor function scores at 2 y of age, with higher scores for boys and lower scores for girls. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to pyrethroids may be associated at 1 y of age with poorer social-emotional development. At 2 y of age, poorer language development was observed with higher prenatal pyrethroid levels. Considering the widespread use of pyrethroids, these findings deserve further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2129.

29355563	Scopolamine	Cognitive Dysfunction	1	0	0	0		Taraxerol as a possible therapeutic agent on memory impairments and Alzheimer's disease: Effects against scopolamine and streptozotocin-induced cognitive dysfunctions.	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive impairment and cholinergic neuronal death, characteristic of the effect of time on biochemical neuronal function. The use of medicinal plants as an alternative form of prevention, or even as a possible treatment of AD, is therefore interesting areas of research, since the standard drugs have many side effects. Taraxerol (TRX) is a triterpene that has been isolated from several plant species, and its various pharmacological properties have already been identified, such the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition activity in vitro. There is a lack of information in literature that confirms the effect of TRX in an animal AD-like model. Seeking to fill this gap in the literature, in the present work we assessed the effect of TRX on AChE activity in the animals' encephalon and hippocampus. We also investigated the effect of TRX (1.77 microM/side, 0.5 muL) isolated from leaves of Eugenia umbelliflora Berg. on aversive memory impairments induced by scopolamine (2 microg/side, 0.5 microL) infused into rat hippocampus, and the effect of TRX (0.89 and 1.77 microM/side, 0.5 muL) on aversive memory impairments induced by streptozotocin (STZ) (2.5 mg/mL, 2.0 microL) infused i.c.v. into mice, using the step-down inhibitory avoidance task. We found that TRX significantly inhibited AChE activity in the animal's hippocampus. Furthermore, TRX significantly improved scopolamine and STZ-induced memory impairment.

L-Asparaginase has significantly improved outcome for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and has become an essential component of multiagent chemotherapy. However, there are many adverse events due to L-asparaginase, including acute pancreatitis. The pathology of L-asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) remains unclear. We compared patients who developed AAP (n=29) and random matched controls (n=36) who had been enrolled in the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study of the ALL-02 protocol. AAP and control patients were matched for age, sex, treatment, and protocol risk. We examined correlations between AAP development and clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and concomitant medication. Abdominal pain and nausea were common presenting symptoms for AAP. There was an increased risk of AAP in patients using gastric acid-suppressing agents and antithrombin (AT) supplementation. Mean fibrinogen and AT levels before the onset of AAP were lower in AAP patients than in controls. Decreased AT and fibrinogen levels resulting from the strong suppression of protein synthesis by L-asparaginase were predictive signs for AAP. Our epidemiological approach should prove clinically useful for the diagnosis the AAP as early as possible.

28532287	Oxytocin	Postpartum Hemorrhage	1	0	0	0		Maternal body mass index and oxytocin exposure in nulliparous women: is there an interaction associated with maternal and neonatal morbidities?	OBJECTIVE: Increasing body mass index (BMI) and administered doses of oxytocin are related to maternal and neonatal morbidities. We evaluated the effect of oxytocin dosage, BMI, and their interaction on select perinatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively studied nulliparas with singletons >/=36 weeks' gestation who received oxytocin and reached the second stage of labor. Oxytocin dosage was defined by the oxytocin product ([maximum oxytocin dose] x [duration of oxytocin infusion]/100 (milliunits)). Outcomes included cesarean, postpartum hemorrhage, puerperal infection, and a composite of neonatal morbidities. Logistic regression produced odds ratios (OR) for BMI and oxytocin product. The final model included a BMI-oxytocin product interaction term. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and four women met enrollment criteria. Increasing BMI was associated with longer duration from first exam to delivery and higher rates of cesarean. Oxytocin dosage increased linearly with BMI (p < .001). There were increasing odds of all four outcomes as both BMI and oxytocin dosage increased (except cesarean with oxytocin). However, there was no significant interaction between BMI and oxytocin for any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: BMI and oxytocin dosage are associated with select maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, the lack of interaction between BMI and oxytocin product suggests that the higher administered dose of oxytocin associated with increasing BMI does not synergistically potentiate maternal and neonatal morbidities.

INTRODUCTION: The use of psychostimulants has been present in common medical practice since the 20th century and has undergone an exponential growth in terms of the number of prescriptions. AIM: To review the current state of knowledge about the side effects of psychostimulants in the child and teen populations. DEVELOPMENT: A review was performed by searching in different databases and included clinical analyses, observational prospective studies and systematic reviews. A minimum increase in blood pressure and heart rate are observed, but some studies highlight an underestimation of the long-term risk. As regards appetite and growth, almost all the current literature points to a slowing of the rate of growth, which is regained on interrupting treatment. One important factor, as is the parallel evolution of bone age, has not been evaluated in most of the studies carried out to date. No significant worsening of sleep was noted in patients treated with psychostimulants with respect to those who are not being treated. With regard to the central nervous system, there does not seem to be any evidence of an increased risk of the appearance or exacerbation of tics following introduction of the treatment. Affect and emotion are areas that have been barely explored. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to have more evidence on the safety of these drugs. It is therefore essential to have access to studies that cover a period of time consistent with the duration of these treatments.

29482571	Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins	Dermatitis, Atopic	1	1	0	0	0.0	Prenatal exposure to TCDD and atopic conditions in the Seveso second generation: a prospective cohort study.	BACKGROUND: 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a toxic environmental contaminant that can bioaccumulate in humans, cross the placenta, and cause immunological effects in children, including altering their risk of developing allergies. On July 10, 1976, a chemical explosion in Seveso, Italy, exposed nearby residents to a high amount of TCDD. In 1996, the Seveso Women's Health Study (SWHS) was established to study the effects of TCDD on women's health. Using data from the Seveso Second Generation Health Study, we aim to examine the effect of prenatal exposure to TCDD on the risk of atopic conditions in SWHS children born after the explosion. METHODS: Individual-level TCDD was measured in maternal serum collected soon after the accident. In 2014, we initiated the Seveso Second Generation Health Study to follow-up the children of the SWHS cohort who were born after the explosion or who were exposed in utero to TCDD. We enrolled 677 children, and cases of atopic conditions, including eczema, asthma, and hay fever, were identified by self-report during personal interviews with the mothers and children. Log-binomial and Poisson regressions were used to determine the association between prenatal TCDD and atopic conditions. RESULTS: A 10-fold increase in 1976 maternal serum TCDD (log(10)TCDD) was not significantly associated with asthma (adjusted relative risk (RR) = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.40) or hay fever (adjusted RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.27), but was significantly inversely associated with eczema (adjusted RR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.99). Maternal TCDD estimated at pregnancy was not significantly associated with eczema, asthma, or hay fever. There was no strong evidence of effect modification by child sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that maternal serum TCDD near the time of explosion is associated with lower risk of eczema, which supports other evidence pointing to the dysregulated immune effects of TCDD.

30654041	Proguanil	Abortion, Spontaneous	0	1	0	0		The safety of atovaquone-proguanil for the prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy: A systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Malaria infection poses a significant risk in pregnancy, yet chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women is limited. A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the incidence of adverse outcomes after atovaquone-proguanil (AP) exposure during pregnancy. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, the authors searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Malaria in Pregnancy Consortium Library to identify relevant literature including infant outcomes after exposure to atovaquone, proguanil, or AP in pregnancy. Two authors independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts, and extracted data into an EpiInfo database. Overall proportions and 95% confidence intervals of adverse outcomes were determined by pooling data across studies. RESULTS: Of 455 records identified, 16 studies were included: ten AP studies and six proguanil studies. The overall proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of adverse outcomes reported for the 446 women exposed to AP include miscarriage (8.08% CI: 5.07, 12.08%), stillbirth (1.05% CI: 0.03, 5.73%), early neonatal death (0% CI: 0, 7.4%), and congenital anomalies (2.56% CI: 1.28, 4.53%). CONCLUSIONS: The limited available data suggest that outcomes following AP exposure during pregnancy are similar to expected rates in similar populations. AP may be a promising option for pregnant women, but further data are needed on its safety in pregnancy.
30680668	Imatinib Mesylate	Anemia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Renal dysfunction and anemia associated with long-term imatinib treatment in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.	Knowledge of the toxicity profile of long-term treatment with imatinib is limited. In the present study, we sought to evaluate renal function and hemoglobin levels during long-term imatinib treatment. Eighty-two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase who had been on imatinib for over 5 years were retrospectively analyzed. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly decreased over 5 years (77 +/- 17 to 62 +/- 14 ml/min/1.73m(2), P < 0.001). Higher age and lower eGFR value at initiation of imatinib were significantly associated with development of renal dysfunction by multivariate analyses. Mean hemoglobin levels also significantly decreased over the 5-year period (12.9 +/- 1.7 to 12.4 +/- 1.3 g/dl, P < 0.01). The rate of decrease in eGFR correlated significantly with hemoglobin levels (correlation coefficient = - 0.249, P < 0.05). Serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels did not increase in 16 patients with both renal dysfunction and anemia (median, 31.9 mIU/ml). In patients who participated in a clinical trial of imatinib discontinuation, mean eGFR (50.0 +/- 6.5 to 56.0 +/- 10.2 ml/min/1.73m(2), P < 0.05) and hemoglobin levels (12.0 +/- 1.7 to 14.0 +/- 1.6 g/dl, P < 0.01) improved significantly at 1 year after discontinuation. These findings suggest that long-term imatinib results in a partially reversible continuous decline in renal function and decreased hemoglobin levels.
29322849	Lenalidomide	Neutropenia	1	0	0	0		Safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes without del(5q): results of a phase 3 trial.	The safety profile of lenalidomide use in lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients with del(5q) is well-established, but less is known in non-del(5q) patients. We provide safety data from a randomized, phase 3 trial evaluating lenalidomide in 239 patients with lower-risk non-del(5q) MDS ineligible/refractory to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Compared with placebo, lenalidomide was associated with a higher incidence of grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 86% vs. 44%), but not risk of infection (p = .817) or hemorrhagic events (p = 1.000). Grade 3-4 non-hematologic TEAEs were rare (the incidence of grade 3-4 pneumonia, e.g. was 5.6% in the lenalidomide group and 2.5% in the placebo group). Common grade 1-2 non-hematologic TEAEs did not require dose modifications or treatment discontinuation. Acute myeloid leukemia and second primary malignancies incidence was similar across treatment groups. Lenalidomide had a predictable and manageable safety profile in lower-risk non-del(5q) MDS patients ineligible/refractory to ESAs. Guidance on managing lenalidomide-related TEAEs is provided to help maintain patients on therapy to achieve maximum clinical benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01029262.

30111350	Piperacillin	Eosinophilia	1	1	0	1	0.0	Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome in two young children: the importance of an early diagnosis.	BACKGROUND: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a serious life-treating condition characterized by skin eruption, fever, haematologic abnormalities, and multi-organ involvement that can be fatal if unrecognized, especially in patients with liver failure. Diagnosis may be difficult because it is rarely described in children and can mimic many different conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of DRESS syndrome due to prolonged antibiotic treatment in young children in whom recovery occurred following different therapeutic approaches. A previously healthy 5-year-old boy had been receiving intravenous vancomycin for right wrist and left elbow osteomyelitis and developed DRESS syndrome on day 30. The patient achieved a complete resolution of all symptoms with pulse methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone. A 4-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis, pancreatic insufficiency, chronic pulmonary colonization by Gram-positive bacteria admitted for pulmonary exacerbation was treated with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam and tobramycin. After 14 days of treatment, she developed DRESS syndrome: antibiotic treatment was therefore stopped, and without any further therapy, a progressive resolution of the patient's clinical features was observed within 7 days, while the normalization of laboratory abnormalities was achieved at 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases highlight that paediatricians should be aware of the clinical presentations of and therapeutic approaches for DRESS syndrome, especially in children receiving long-term antibiotic treatment. The removal of the offending drug is crucial and may be the only life-saving measure. In more aggressive cases, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive drugs should be considered to achieve the best outcome.

29169272	Estrogens	Breast Neoplasms	1	1	1	1	1.0	A Case of Benign Phyllodes Tumor in a Transgender Woman Receiving Cross-Sex Hormones.	Phyllodes tumor is a relatively uncommon fibroepithelial neoplasm of the breast characterized by proliferation of both stromal and epithelial elements. Benign phyllodes tumors are distinguished from fibroadenomas by their prominent leaf-like architecture and exaggerated intracanalicular stromal growth pattern. Typically, these lesions affect older natal females; however, we present what we believe is the first reported case of benign phyllodes tumor in a hormonally treated transgender woman.
30051965	Cholesterol	Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease	1	0	0	0		Galactomannan More than Pectin Exacerbates Liver Injury in Mice Fed with High-Fat, High-Cholesterol Diet.	SCOPE: Galactomannan and citrus pectin are considered 'super fibers' known for altering gut microbiota composition and improving glucose and lipid metabolism. The study aims to investigate the fiber's effect on a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two feeding experiments are carried out using groups of 7-8 week-old male C57BL/6J mice. The diets used are based on a high cholesterol/cholate diet (HCD), such as a nutritional NASH model. Mice are fed a diet with or without 15% fiber-citrus pectin (HCD-CP) or galactomannan (HCD-G) together with the HCD (first experiment), which commenced 3 weeks prior to the HCD (second experiment). Liver damage is evaluated by histological and biochemical parameters. Galactomannan leads to lesser weight gain and improved glucose tolerance, but increased liver damage. This is shown by elevated levels of liver enzymes compared to that with HCD alone. Fibers induce higher steatosis, as evaluated by liver histology. This intriguing result is linked to various changes in the gut microbiota, such as elevated Proteobacteria levels in the galactomannan group, which are correlated with disturbed metabolism and dysbiosis. CONCLUSIONS: In a NASH mouse model, galactomannan increases liver damage but improves glucose metabolism. Changes in the microbiota composition may answer this enigmatic observation.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), statin, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor on the development of kidney, prostate, and urothelial cancers by analyzing the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among a representative sample cohort of 1,025,340 participants in NHIS-NSC database in 2002, we extracted data of 799,850 individuals who visited the hospital more than once, and finally included 321,122 individuals aged 40 and older. Following a 1-year washout period between 2002 and 2003, we analyzed 143,870 (male), 320,861 and 320,613 individuals for evaluating the risk of prostate cancer, kidney cancer and urothelial cancer developments, respectively, during 10-year follow-up periods between 2004 and 2013. The medication group consisted of patients prescribed these drugs more than 60% of the time in 2003. To adjustfor various parameters of the patients, a multivariate Cox regression model was adopted. RESULTS: During 10-year follow-up periods between 2004 and 2013, 9,627 (6.7%), 1,107 (0.4%), and 2,121 (0.7%) patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer, kidney cancer, and urothelial cancer, respectively. Notably, multivariate analyses revealed that NSAIDs significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35). Also, it was found that aspirin (HR, 1.28) and statin (HR, 1.55) elevated the risk of kidney cancer. No drugs were associated with the risk of urothelial cancer. CONCLUSION: In sum, our study provides the valuable information for the impact of aspirin, NSAID, statin, and COX-2 inhibitor on the risk of prostate, kidney, and urothelial cancer development and its survival outcomes.

29486725	Nivolumab	Acute Kidney Injury	1	1	1	1	1.0	Immune checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab)-associated kidney injury and the importance of recognizing concomitant medications known to cause acute tubulointerstitial nephritis: a case report.	BACKGROUND: Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) has been increasingly recognized as an important manifestation of kidney injury associated with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4). While the exact pathophysiology remains unknown, corticosteroids are the mainstay of management. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 67-year-old man with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer who developed kidney injury during treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. A kidney biopsy showed ATIN without granuloma formation. Considering their mechanism of action, immune checkpoint inhibitors can alter immunological tolerance to concomitant drugs that have been safely used for a long time. For more than 4 years before the initiation of nivolumab therapy, the patient had been receiving the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole, known to cause drug-induced ATIN, without significant adverse events including kidney injury. He showed rapid improvement in kidney function in 3 days (creatinine decreased from 2.74 to 1.82 mg/dl) on discontinuation of lansoprazole. He then received 500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days followed by 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone and his creatinine levels eventually stabilized around 1.7 mg/dl. Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) for lansoprazole was positive. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid improvement of kidney function after discontinuation and DLST positivity indicate that lansoprazole contributed to the development of ATIN during nivolumab therapy. Considering the time course, it is plausible that nivolumab altered the long-lasting immunological tolerance against lansoprazole in this patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of DLST positivity for a drug that had been used safely before the initiation of an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Although corticosteroid therapy is recommended, the recognition and discontinuation of concomitant drugs, especially those known to induce ATIN, is necessary for the management of kidney injury associated with anti-PD-1 therapy.

29724299	Bendamustine Hydrochloride	Nausea	0	0	0	0		Comparison of antiemetic effects of granisetron and palonosetron in patients receiving bendamustine-based chemotherapy.	The antiemetic effects and safety of granisetron and palonosetron against chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were retrospectively evaluated in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving bendamustine-based chemotherapy. A total of 61 patients were eligible for this study. Before starting the bendamustine-based chemotherapy, granisetron or palonosetron were intravenously administered with or without aprepitant and/or dexamethasone. The proportions of patients with complete control (CC) during the overall (during the 6 days after the start of the chemotherapy), acute (up to 2 days), and delayed (3 to 6 days) phases were assessed. CC was defined as complete response with only grade 0-1 nausea, no vomiting, and no use of antiemetic rescue medication. Granisetron or palonosetron alone were administered to 9 and 19 patients, respectively. Aprepitant and/or dexamethasone were combined with granisetron and palonosetron in 28 and 5 patients, respectively. Acute CINV was completely controlled in all patients. Both granisetron monotherapy and palonosetron combination therapy could provide good control of delayed CINV, although the CC rates during the delayed and overall phases were not significantly different among mono- and combination therapy of the antiemetics. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of adverse drug events between the granisetron and palonosetron treatment groups. The present study showed that the antiemetic efficacy and safety of granisetron-based therapy were non-inferior to those of palonosetron-based therapy. Taken together with treatment costs, granisetron monotherapy would be adequate to prevent CINV in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma receiving bendamustine-based chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (VD) insufficiency or deficiency is a frequent comorbidity in Chinese women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). The present study aimed to investigate 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] improvement and calcium-phosphate metabolism in Chinese PMO patients treated with 70 mg of alendronate sodium and 5600 IU of vitamin D(3) (ALN/D5600). METHODS: Chinese PMO women (n = 219) were treated with 12-month ALN/D5600 (n = 111) or calcitriol (n = 108). Changes in 25(OH) D at month 12 were post hoc analyzed by the baseline 25 (OH) D status using the longitudinal analysis. The main safety outcome measures included serum calcium and phosphate and 24-h urine calcium, and the repeated measures mixed model was used to assess the frequencies of the calcium-phosphate metabolic disorders. RESULTS: Absolute change in mean serum 25(OH) D level was the greatest in VD-deficient patients and least in VD-sufficient patients at months six and 12 (both, P < 0.01). Serum calcium level remained significantly lower in the ALN/D5600 treatment group than in the calcitriol treatment group throughout the 12 months. Mean 24-h urine calcium slightly increased in the ALN/D5600 treatment group and significantly increased in the calcitriol treatment group (+ 1.1 and + 0.9 mmol/L at months six and 12; both, P < 0.05). Calcitriol treatment was associated with more frequent hypercalciuria at month six (9.4% vs. 18.5%, P = 0.05), but not at month 12 (12.3% vs. 13.0%). CONCLUSION: Baseline VD status predicted 25(OH) D improvement in PMO patients on 12-month ALN/D5600 treatment. The daily use of 0.25 mug of calcitriol was associated with more frequent hypercalciuria at month six, compared to ALN/5600 treatment, necessitating the safety re-evaluation of calcitriol at a higher dosage.

30232205	Cocaine	Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis	1	1	0	1	1.0	Unusual case of levamisole-induced dual-positive ANCA vasculitis and crescentic glomerulonephritis.	Cocaine adulterated levamisole is an increasingly reported cause of skin necrosis, arthralgia and systemic vasculitis, but renal involvement is uncommon. We present a case of a 40-year-old Hispanic man with a history of cocaine abuse who presented with acute kidney injury to the rheumatology clinic where he was being treated for chronic inflammatory arthritis. He was found to have a serum creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL, microscopic haematuria and subnephrotic proteinuria, along with positive proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, anticardiolipin antibodies and an elevated antinuclear antibody titre. The renal pathology revealed focal necrotising glomerulonephritis with crescentic features and mild immune type deposition. The patient was treated with cocaine abstinence, pulse dose steroids followed by maintenance prednisone, rituximab and cyclophosphamide. His renal function subsequently improved but did not normalise.

Cocaine adulterated levamisole is an increasingly reported cause of skin necrosis, arthralgia and systemic vasculitis, but renal involvement is uncommon. We present a case of a 40-year-old Hispanic man with a history of cocaine abuse who presented with acute kidney injury to the rheumatology clinic where he was being treated for chronic inflammatory arthritis. He was found to have a serum creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL, microscopic haematuria and subnephrotic proteinuria, along with positive proteinase 3, myeloperoxidase, anticardiolipin antibodies and an elevated antinuclear antibody titre. The renal pathology revealed focal necrotising glomerulonephritis with crescentic features and mild immune type deposition. The patient was treated with cocaine abstinence, pulse dose steroids followed by maintenance prednisone, rituximab and cyclophosphamide. His renal function subsequently improved but did not normalise. We believe that his incomplete improvement was due to the degree of kidney injury on presentation as well as recidivism with cocaine use.

29949582	Hyaluronic Acid	Glaucoma	0	0	0	0		A murine glaucoma model induced by rapid in vivo photopolymerization of hyaluronic acid glycidyl methacrylate.	Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy commonly associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) resulting in progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve degeneration, leading to blindness. New therapeutic approaches that better preserve the visual field by promoting survival and health of RGCs are highly needed since RGC death occurs despite good IOP control in glaucoma patients. We have developed a novel approach to reliably induce chronic IOP elevation in mouse using a photopolymerizable biomatrix, hyaluronic acid glycidyl methacrylate. This is achieved by rapid in vivo crosslinking of the biomatrix at the iridocorneal angle by a flash of ultraviolet A (UVA) light to impede the aqueous outflow pathway with a controllable manner. Sustained IOP elevation was induced after a single manipulation and was maintained at ~45% above baseline for >4 weeks. Significant thinning of the inner retina and ~35% reduction in RGCs and axons was noted within one month of IOP elevation. Optic nerve degeneration showed positive correlation with cumulative IOP elevation. Activation of astrocytes and microglia appeared to be an early event in response to IOP elevation preceding detectable RGC and axon loss. Attenuated glial reactivity was noted at later stage where significant RGC/axon loss had occurred suggesting astrocytes and microglia may play different roles over the course of glaucomatous degeneration. This novel murine glaucoma model is reproducible and displays cellular changes that recapitulate several pathophysiological features of glaucoma.
30383755	Diclofenac	Myocardial Infarction	1	1	0	0	0.0	Risk of acute myocardial infarction during use of individual NSAIDs: A nested case-control study from the SOS project.	BACKGROUND: Use of selective COX-2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (coxibs) has been associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the risk of AMI has only been studied for very few NSAIDs that are frequently used. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the risk of AMI for individual NSAIDs. METHODS: A nested case-control study was performed from a cohort of new NSAID users >/=18 years (1999-2011) matching cases to a maximum of 100 controls on database, sex, age, and calendar time. Data were retrieved from six healthcare databases. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of current use of individual NSAIDs compared to past use were estimated per database. Pooling was done by two-stage pooling using a random effects model (ORmeta) and by one-stage pooling (ORpool). RESULTS: Among 8.5 million new NSAID users, 79,553 AMI cases were identified. The risk was elevated for current use of ketorolac (ORmeta 2.06;95%CI 1.83-2.32, ORpool 1.80; 1.49-2.18) followed, in descending order of point estimate, by indometacin, etoricoxib, rofecoxib, diclofenac, fixed combination of diclofenac with misoprostol, piroxicam, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, meloxicam, nimesulide and ketoprofen (ORmeta 1.12; 1.03-1.22, ORpool 1.00;0.86-1.16). Higher doses showed higher risk estimates than lower doses. CONCLUSIONS: The relative risk estimates of AMI differed slightly between 28 individual NSAIDs. The relative risk was highest for ketorolac and was correlated with COX-2 potency, but not restricted to coxibs.

29687449	Amlodipine	Gingival Overgrowth	1	1	0	0	0.0	Influence of 3 calcium channel blockers on gingival overgrowth in a population of severe refractory hypertensive patients.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to assess the association between 3 different calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (nifedipine, amlodipine and felodipine) and gingival overgrowth in patients with a diagnosis of severe refractory hypertension. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-two patients with severe refractory hypertension, taking CCBs, were selected. Gingival overgrowth was graded and periodontal measurements were recorded (probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, plaque index and bleeding on probing). Unconditional multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between CCB intake and gingival overgrowth after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Of the 162 patients, 26 (16.0%) were current smokers and 101 (62.3%) were females. The mean age (SD) was 54.1 (8.5) years and the median age (range) 52.5 (39-78) years. Gingival overgrowth was observed in 55 patients (34.0%). Nifedipine was the most common medication (35.2%; 57 of 162). The results of multiple binary logistic regression showed statistically significant associations between CCB intake (exposure) and gingival overgrowth (outcome) after adjusting for the variables treatment time with antihypertensive and plaque index. Patients with gingival overgrowth were 2.5 (odds ratio = 2.46; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-5.82) and 4.0 (odds ratio = 3.90; 95% confidence interval: 1.47-10.35) times more likely to be taking nifedipine and amlodipine, respectively, than patients without gingival overgrowth. On the other hand, this significant association was not observed for felodipine. CONCLUSION: Nifedipine and amlodipine, but not felodipine, were associated with gingival overgrowth in patients with severe refractory hypertension.

29525688	Clomiphene	Pregnancy Complications	0	0	0	0		Comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes of Chinese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome with and without antiandrogenic pretreatment.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in healthy Chinese women and to investigate whether these outcomes could be decreased in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate (EE/CPA) pretreatment. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Medical university. PATIENT(S): Six thousand healthy women (group A) were selected from 24,566 pregnant women by randomized sampling. Four hundred forty-eight patients with PCOS without EE/CPA pretreatment were assigned to group B, and 222 patients with PCOS with 3 months of pretreatment to group C. All patients with PCOS had biochemical and/or clinical hyperandrogenism and conceived within 3 monthly ovulation inductions using clomiphene. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), premature delivery (PD), and neonatal birth weight. RESULT(S): The prevalence of GDM, PIH, and PD was higher in group B than in groups A and C (A vs. B vs. C: GDM, 21.2% vs. 35.0% vs. 22.5%; PIH, 6.5% vs. 14.1% vs. 7.7%; PD, 5.4% vs. 8.6% vs. 6.8%). No significant difference was found in neonatal birth weight. After adjusting for age, pregestational body mass index, education level, and employment status, PCOS without pretreatment increased the risk of GDM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.666; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.340-2.072), PIH (aOR = 1.487; 95% CI, 1.093-2.023), and PD (aOR = 1.522; 95% CI 1.051-2.205), compared with healthy women. No increased risk was found in group C. CONCLUSION(S): In our highly selected study population, patients with PCOS are more likely to develop GDM, PIH, and PD. Pretreatment with EE/CPA was associated with a lower risk of GDM, PIH, and PD.

29392569	Propylene Glycol	Acidosis	1	0	0	0		Assessing Propylene Glycol Toxicity in Alcohol Withdrawal Patients Receiving Intravenous Benzodiazepines: A One-Compartment Pharmacokinetic Model.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: While some case reports indicate that high doses of propylene glycol (PG) may result in metabolic acidosis, there has been no large-scale study that evaluated the risk of metabolic acidosis in patients receiving PG-containing benzodiazepines for acute alcohol withdrawal. This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential toxicity of PG in patients with acute alcohol withdrawal treated with intermittent intravenous bolus doses of diazepam and/or lorazepam. METHODS: This is a retrospective case study using data collected from 18 randomly selected patients receiving one or both of these medications per a modified Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) Class 3 protocol. Plasma levels of PG were estimated using a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. RESULTS: Only two patients had an elevated anion gap compared to their baseline value with one also experiencing a significant increase in serum creatinine. No increases in serum osmolarity were noted. Analysis showed that the benzodiazepine dose received was a good predictor of the estimated PG concentration (r = 0.6), but was poorly correlated with the anion gap. No significant correlation was found with the creatinine clearance or serum creatinine. Patients receiving several daily doses were at higher risk of developing an anion gap (r = 0.33), but the estimated maximum PG concentration did not correlate with the anion gap or serum concentration. CONCLUSION: It does not appear that intermittent bolus administration of intravenous benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal influenced renal function or anion gap regardless of number of administered doses, amount of PG received, or the estimated PG concentration.
30056126	Oxaliplatin	Peripheral Nervous System Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Targeting the TREK-1 potassium channel via riluzole to eliminate the neuropathic and depressive-like effects of oxaliplatin.	Neurotoxicity remains the most common adverse effect of oxaliplatin, limiting its clinical use. In the present study, we developed a mouse model of chronic oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, which mimics both sensory and motor deficits observed in patients, in a clinically relevant time course. Repeated oxaliplatin administration in mice induced both cephalic and extracephalic long lasting mechanical and cold hypersensitivity after the first injection as well as delayed sensorimotor deficits and a depression-like phenotype. Using this model, we report that riluzole prevents both sensory and motor deficits induced by oxaliplatin as well as the depression-like phenotype induced by cumulative chemotherapeutic drug doses. All the beneficial effects are due to riluzole action on the TREK-1 potassium channel, which plays a central role in its therapeutic action. Riluzole has no negative effect on oxaliplatin antiproliferative capacity in human colorectal cancer cells and on its anticancer effect in a mouse model of colorectal cancer. Moreover, riluzole decreases human colorectal cancer cell line viability in vitro and inhibits polyp development in vivo. The present data in mice may support the need to clinically test riluzole in oxaliplatin-treated cancer patients and state for the important role of the TREK-1 channel in pain perception.

29609683	Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone	Cardiovascular Diseases	0	0	0	0		Are GnRH and FSH potentially damaging factors in the cardiovascular system?	In the physiological view the human cardiomyocytes express receptors of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. The local effects of these hormones in the heart are related also to some interstitial cells, such as endothelial cells with follicle-stimulating hormone receptors and immune cells with gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors. The administration of androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular complications. It is suggested that negative action of this therapy on cardiovascular system is due to the loss of testosterone but also levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone are changed by therapy. In this article we review the literature to date with an emphasis on recent investigation focused on potential role of abnormal gonadotropin-releasing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists on the cardiovascular risk. These facts exacerbate the complexity of specific hormone and cell relationships within heart and vessels. Androgen deprivation therapy reveals the physiological relationships between hormones and specific tissues that are not part of the endocrine system.

30103263	Insulin	Hypertension	0	0	0	0		Treatments for women with gestational diabetes mellitus: an overview of Cochrane systematic reviews.	BACKGROUND: Successful treatments for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have the potential to improve health outcomes for women with GDM and their babies. OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive synthesis of evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews of the benefits and harms associated with interventions for treating GDM on women and their babies. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (5 January 2018) for reviews of treatment/management for women with GDM. Reviews of pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes were excluded.Two overview authors independently assessed reviews for inclusion, quality (AMSTAR; ROBIS), quality of evidence (GRADE), and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 reviews. Of these, 10 provided relevant high-quality and low-risk of bias data (AMSTAR and ROBIS) from 128 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 27 comparisons, 17,984 women, 16,305 babies, and 1441 children. Evidence ranged from high- to very low-quality (GRADE). Only one effective intervention was found for treating women with GDM.EffectiveLifestyle versus usual careLifestyle intervention versus usual care probably reduces large-for-gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.71; 6 RCTs, N = 2994; GRADE moderate-quality).PromisingNo evidence for any outcome for any comparison could be classified to this category.Ineffective or possibly harmful Lifestyle versus usual careLifestyle intervention versus usual care probably increases the risk of induction of labour (IOL) suggesting possible harm (average RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.46; 4 RCTs, N = 2699; GRADE moderate-quality).Exercise versus controlExercise intervention versus control for return to pre-pregnancy weight suggested ineffectiveness (body mass index, BMI) MD 0.11 kg/m(2), 95% CI -1.04 to 1.26; 3 RCTs, N = 254; GRADE moderate-quality).Insulin versus oral therapyInsulin intervention versus oral therapy probably increases the risk of IOL suggesting possible harm (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; 3 RCTs, N = 348; GRADE moderate-quality).Probably ineffective or harmful interventionsInsulin versus oral therapyFor insulin compared to oral therapy there is probably an increased risk of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.12; 4 RCTs, N = 1214; GRADE moderate-quality).InconclusiveLifestyle versus usual careThe evidence for childhood adiposity kg/m(2) (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 RCTs, N = 767; GRADE moderate-quality) and hypoglycaemia was inconclusive (average RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.52; 6 RCTs, N = 3000; GRADE moderate-quality).Exercise versus controlThe evidence for caesarean section (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 5 RCTs, N = 316; GRADE moderate quality) and perinatal death or serious morbidity composite was inconclusive (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.61; 2 RCTs, N = 169; GRADE moderate-quality).Insulin versus oral therapyThe evidence for the following outcomes was inconclusive: pre-eclampsia (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; 10 RCTs, N = 2060), caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 17 RCTs, N = 1988), large-for-gestational age (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35; 13 RCTs, N = 2352), and perinatal death or serious morbidity composite (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.26; 2 RCTs, N = 760). GRADE assessment was moderate-quality for these outcomes.Insulin versus dietThe evidence for perinatal mortality was inconclusive (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.33; 4 RCTs, N = 1137; GRADE moderate-quality).Insulin versus insulinThe evidence for insulin aspart versus lispro for risk of caesarean section was inconclusive (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; 3 RCTs, N = 410; GRADE moderate quality).No conclusions possibleNo conclusions were possible for: lifestyle versus usual care (perineal trauma, postnatal depression, neonatal adiposity, number of antenatal visits/admissions); diet versus control (pre-eclampsia, caesarean section); myo-inositol versus placebo (hypoglycaemia); metformin versus glibenclamide (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension, death or serious morbidity composite, insulin versus oral therapy (development of type 2 diabetes); intensive management versus routine care (IOL, large-for-gestational age); post- versus pre-prandial glucose monitoring (large-for-gestational age). The evidence ranged from moderate-, low- and very low-quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is insufficient high-quality evidence about the effects on health outcomes of relevance for women with GDM and their babies for many of the comparisons in this overview comparing treatment interventions for women with GDM. Lifestyle changes (including as a minimum healthy eating, physical activity and self-monitoring of blood sugar levels) was the only intervention that showed possible health improvements for women and their babies. Lifestyle interventions may result in fewer babies being large. Conversely, in terms of harms, lifestyle interventions may also increase the number of inductions. Taking insulin was also associated with an increase in hypertensive disorders, when compared to oral therapy. There was very limited information on long-term health and health services costs. Further high-quality research is needed.

28276483	Angiotensin II	Hypertension	0	0	0	0		Vascular transcriptome profiling identifies Sphingosine kinase 1 as a modulator of angiotensin II-induced vascular dysfunction.	Vascular dysfunction is an important phenomenon in hypertension. We hypothesized that angiotensin II (AngII) affects transcriptome in the vasculature in a region-specific manner, which may help to identify genes related to vascular dysfunction in AngII-induced hypertension. Mesenteric artery and aortic transcriptome was profiled using Illumina WG-6v2.0 chip in control and AngII infused (490 ng/kg/min) hypertensive mice. Gene set enrichment and leading edge analyses identified Sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) in the highest number of pathways affected by AngII. Sphk1 mRNA, protein and activity were up-regulated in the hypertensive vasculature. Chronic sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) infusion resulted in a development of significantly increased vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction. AngII-induced hypertension was blunted in Sphk1(-/-) mice (systolic BP 167 +/- 4.2 vs. 180 +/- 3.3 mmHg, p < 0.05), which was associated with decreased aortic and mesenteric vasoconstriction in hypertensive Sphk1(-/-) mice. Pharmacological inhibition of S1P synthesis reduced vasoconstriction of mesenteric arteries. While Sphk1 is important in mediating vasoconstriction in hypertension, Sphk1(-/-) mice were characterized by enhanced endothelial dysfunction, suggesting a local protective role of Sphk1 in the endothelium. S1P serum level in humans was correlated with endothelial function (arterial tonometry). Thus, vascular transcriptome analysis shows that S1P pathway is critical in the regulation of vascular function in AngII-induced hypertension, although Sphk1 may have opposing roles in the regulation of vasoconstriction and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation.
29804294	Amoxicillin	Nausea	0	0	0	0		Ten-day high-dose proton pump inhibitor triple therapy versus sequential therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori following standard triple therapy are declining worldwide, but high-dose proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy (HD-PPI-TT) and sequential therapy (ST) have demonstrated higher cure rates. We aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of HD-PPI-TT and ST in H. pylori-associated functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: One hundred and twenty H. pylori-associated functional dyspepsia patients were randomized to receive 10-day HD-PPI-TT (60 mg lansoprazole/500 mg clarithromycin/1 g amoxicillin, each administered twice daily for 10 days) or 10-day ST (30 mg lansoprazole/1 g amoxicillin, each administered twice daily for 5 days followed by 30 mg lansoprazole/500 mg clarithromycin/400 mg metronidazole, each administered twice daily for 5 days). H. pylori status was determined in post-treatment week 4 by (14) C-urea breath test. Eradication and antibiotic resistance rates, dyspeptic symptoms, drug compliance, and adverse effects were compared. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat eradication rates were similar in the ST and HD-PPI-TT groups (85% vs. 80%; P = 0.47). However, the eradication rate was significantly higher following ST compared with HD-PPI-TT in per protocol analysis (94.4% vs. 81.4%; P = 0.035). ST achieved higher cure rates than HD-PPI-TT in clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains (100% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.02). Treatment compliance was similar in the HD-PPI-TT and ST groups, although nausea and dizziness were more common in the ST group. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential therapy achieved better H. pylori eradication than HD-PPI-TT in patients with FD. However, the eradication rate for ST fell from 94.4% in per protocol to 85% in intention-to-treat analysis. Adverse effects might result in poorer compliance and compromise actual ST efficacy (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01888237).
29804294	Clarithromycin	Dizziness	0	0	0	0		Ten-day high-dose proton pump inhibitor triple therapy versus sequential therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori following standard triple therapy are declining worldwide, but high-dose proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy (HD-PPI-TT) and sequential therapy (ST) have demonstrated higher cure rates. We aimed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of HD-PPI-TT and ST in H. pylori-associated functional dyspepsia (FD). METHODS: One hundred and twenty H. pylori-associated functional dyspepsia patients were randomized to receive 10-day HD-PPI-TT (60 mg lansoprazole/500 mg clarithromycin/1 g amoxicillin, each administered twice daily for 10 days) or 10-day ST (30 mg lansoprazole/1 g amoxicillin, each administered twice daily for 5 days followed by 30 mg lansoprazole/500 mg clarithromycin/400 mg metronidazole, each administered twice daily for 5 days). H. pylori status was determined in post-treatment week 4 by (14) C-urea breath test. Eradication and antibiotic resistance rates, dyspeptic symptoms, drug compliance, and adverse effects were compared. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat eradication rates were similar in the ST and HD-PPI-TT groups (85% vs. 80%; P = 0.47). However, the eradication rate was significantly higher following ST compared with HD-PPI-TT in per protocol analysis (94.4% vs. 81.4%; P = 0.035).

29280005	Fluorouracil	Peripheral Nervous System Diseases	1	0	0	0		Goshajinkigan for prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) limits the dose of chemotherapy and reduces patients' quality of life. Goshajinkigan is a Japanese herbal medicine used to alleviate neuropathy and general pain. A clinical guideline for prevention and management of CIPN stated that the prophylactic efficacy of goshajinkigan against CIPN was inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review to examine whether goshajinkigan prevents CIPN in patients receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Ichushi, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for eligible trials. Randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of goshajinkigan for prevention of CIPN were included. Our primary outcomes were incidence of CIPN, response to chemotherapy, and adverse effects. We pooled data using a random effects model. RESULTS: We analyzed five trials involving a total of 397 patients. When evaluated with Neurotoxicity Criteria of Debiopharm, goshajinkigan was associated with reduced incidence of CIPN of grade >/= 1 (risk ratio [RR] 0.43; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66) and grade 3 (RR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.71), but this beneficial association was not found for grade >/= 2 of CIPN. Goshajinkigan was not associated with reduced incidence of CIPN when assessed with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, or improved response to chemotherapy. Goshajinkigan was well tolerated based on one trial. CONCLUSIONS: Goshajinkigan is unlikely to prevent CIPN in patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy. Given the low quality and insufficient amount of the evidence, use of goshajinkigan as standard of care is not currently recommended.

30762762	Amiodarone	Arrhythmias, Cardiac	1	0	0	0		Aggravation of atrial arrhythmia by amiodarone during the perinatal period: A case report.	RATIONALE: Amiodarone, a broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic drug, is widely used for the clinical treatment of tachyarrhythmias because of its safety and efficacy. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 30-year-old woman presented with known paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and severe preeclampsia. Two days before admission, she had given birth to twins. She described her symptoms as a sudden palpitation at 10:20 accompanied by chest tightness and shortness of breath. DIAGNOSIS: Cardiac arrhythmia and acute left heart failure. INTERVENTIONS: Furosemide and sodium nitroprusside were administered to control the heart failure. At 16:20, 150 mg amiodarone (15 mg/min) was injected intravenously and continued at 1 mg/min. At 16:50, her electrocardiogram showed possible atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter with a ventricular rate of 206 beats/min. Administration of amiodarone was stopped at 17:23, and the medication was changed to esmolol. OUTCOMES: After 3 minutes, the palpitations stopped, the heart rate changed to a sinus rhythm, and the ventricular rate was 100 beats/min. Four days later, the patient underwent an electrophysiologic study and radiofrequency ablation. LESSONS: When amiodarone is used to treat atrial arrhythmia, the ventricular rate may accelerate, which can cause patients with borderline heart failure to develop acute heart failure or further deterioration of acute heart failure. For heart failure induced or mediated by atrial arrhythmias, short-term beta-blockers may be used to control the ventricular rate more quickly and effectively and to prevent the progression of heart failure.

28825377	Carboplatin	Hematologic Diseases	0	0	0	0		Effectiveness of adjuvant carboplatin-based chemotherapy compared to cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer.	BACKGROUND: Cisplatin and vinorelbine given intravenously is a well-established adjuvant chemotherapy regimen after surgery for early non-small cell lung cancer. However, few validated alternatives exist when cisplatin is not indicated or tolerated. Carboplatin is frequently used in this setting. We evaluated the 5-year overall survival, progression-free survival and toxicity in patients treated for stage IB to IIIB resected non-small cell lung cancer receiving adjuvant carboplatin-based chemotherapy compared to cisplatin in association with vinorelbine. METHODS: Single-center retrospective study of patients having received adjuvant chemotherapy between January 2004 and December 2013 at the oncology clinic at Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Quebec (Canada). Three sub-groups, cisplatin/vinorelbine, carboplatin/vinorelbine and the substitution of cisplatin/vinorelbine for carboplatin/vinorelbine (cisplatin/vinorelbine/carboplatin/vinorelbine), were studied during treatment. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients were included in this study. The median PFS was not significantly different, with 50.4 months for cisplatin/vinorelbine, 57.3 months for cisplatin/vinorelbine/carboplatin/vinorelbine and not yet achieved for the carboplatin/vinorelbine group ( p = 0.80). Overall survival also did not differ significantly between the three groups. The 5-year overall survival rates were 66% in cisplatin/vinorelbine group, 55% in carboplatin/vinorelbine group and 70% in cisplatin/vinorelbine/carboplatin/vinorelbine group ( p = 0, 95). No differences were noted between groups concerning high-grade hematologic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Although the effectiveness and hematologic toxicity are comparable between cisplat in and carboplatin in the adjuvant treatment of resected non-small cell lung cancer, the results obtained corroborate the practice used at our oncology clinic. Nevertheless, more prospective studies would be needed to confirm these results.

29300515	Prednisone	Orbital Diseases	1	1	0	0	1.0	Chemotherapy-induced exacerbations of thyroid orbitopathy in a patient with B-cell lymphoma.	A 55-year-old woman with concurrent active thyroid orbitopathy and B-cell lymphoma developed acute exacerbation of thyroid orbitopathy after receiving Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, Prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy, presenting with subtotal loss of vision and severe eyelid edema. Intravenous methylprednisolone was fully effective within several hours. Further exacerbations of her orbitopathy were seen following every subsequent chemotherapeutic treatment, but responded well to oral prednisone. This case shows that thyroid orbitopathy may severely and acutely progress after chemotherapy for concurrent B-cell lymphoma. Clinical awareness of this potential complication may prevent blindness in this rare subset of patients.
28978980	Sodium Chloride	Hypertension, Renal	0	0	0	0		Role of bardoxolone methyl, a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 activator, in aldosterone- and salt-induced renal injury.	The aim of this study was to investigate the renoprotective effect of bardoxolone methyl (BM), a nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activator with an antioxidant effect, in a salt-sensitive hypertension model induced by aldosterone (Ald) and salt. Tubulointerstitial damage with urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) was evaluated using human L-FABP chromosomal transgenic (L-FABP(+/-)) male mice. The mice in the Ald group (n=7) received systemic Ald infusions via an osmotic minipump and were given 1% NaCl water for 35 days. Those in the Ald-BM group (n=8) were administered BM intraperitoneally in addition to an injection of Ald and salt. The dose of BM was gradually increased every 7 days up to 10 mg kg(-1) per day, which was maintained for 14 days. The administration of BM significantly increased renal expression of the Nrf2 target antioxidant gene. Tubulointerstitial damage was significantly ameliorated in the Ald-BM group compared to the Ald group. The increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulation of angiotensinogen expression in the kidneys of the Ald group was significantly prevented in the Ald-BM group. The upregulation of human L-FABP expression induced in the kidneys and increase in urinary L-FABP in the Ald group were significantly suppressed by BM administration. In conclusion, BM ameliorated tubulointerstitial damage in the Ald- and salt-induced hypertension model through suppression of both ROS production and intrarenal renin-angiotensin system activation. Urinary L-FABP may be a useful marker reflecting the therapeutic efficacy of BM.
29873957	Mianserin	Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2	1	0	0	0		Risk of Diabetes Hospitalization or Diabetes Drug Intensification in Patients With Depression and Diabetes Using Second-Generation Antipsychotics Compared to Other Depression Therapies.	OBJECTIVE: Use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for treatment of depression has increased, and patients with depression and comorbid diabetes or cardiovascular disease are more likely to use SGAs than those without these conditions. We compared SGA and non-SGA depression pharmacotherapies on the risk of diabetes hospitalization or treatment intensification in adults with depression and preexisting diabetes. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of US commercially insured adults (2009-2015 Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database) aged 18-64 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus and unipolar depression previously treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. New users of SGAs versus non-SGAs, as well as specific treatments (aripiprazole, quetiapine, bupropion, mirtazapine, and tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]) were matched on class/medication-specific high-dimensional propensity score. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the risk of diabetes-related hospitalization or treatment intensification. RESULTS: We identified 6,625 SGA (aripiprazole = 3,461; quetiapine = 1,977; other = 1,187) and 23,921 non-SGA patients for inclusion (bupropion = 15,511; mirtazapine = 1,837; TCAs = 5,989; other = 584) with a mean age of 51 years. In the matched cohort, the rate of diabetes-related hospitalization or drug intensification was 47.9 per 100 person-years in the SGA group and 43.5 per 100 person-years in the non-SGA group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96-1.11). When comparing treatment subgroups, the risk of events was lower for bupropion versus TCAs (aHR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98), quetiapine versus mirtazapine (aHR = 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-0.99), and quetiapine versus TCAs (aHR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98). For other comparisons, differences were small and not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: While drug-specific effects on risk of diabetes hospitalization or treatment intensification most likely guide clinical decision making, we observed only modest differences in risk. The overall impact of SGAs on diabetes control depends not only on direct effects on glucose metabolism but also on effectiveness of depression symptom relief. Future studies evaluating other diabetes outcomes (glycosylated hemoglobin, diabetes complications) are needed.

30238510	Dimethyl Fumarate	Flushing	0	0	0	0		Clinical use of dimethyl fumarate in moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis: a European expert consensus.	Fumaric acid esters (FAEs) are a group of small molecules that were first investigated for the treatment of psoriasis in 1959. The first fumarate-based drug - Fumaderm((R)) - was approved in Germany in 1994 for severe psoriasis and then in 2008, the label was expanded to include moderate psoriasis. Fumaderm is a combination of different FAEs: dimethyl fumarate (DMF), which is regarded as the main active component, plus calcium, magnesium and zinc salts of monoethyl fumarate (MEF). FAEs are the most frequently used first-line systemic psoriasis treatment in Germany, with an overall treatment experience comprising more than 220 000 patient-years. FAEs have demonstrated good, sustained clinical efficacy with an acceptable safety profile for the long-term treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Indeed, the European S3-Guideline on the systemic treatment of Psoriasis vulgaris recommends FAEs for induction and long-term treatment. Until recently, FAEs were only licensed (for the psoriasis indication) in Germany, but were imported to many other European countries, such as The Netherlands, UK, Ireland, Austria and Italy, for the treatment of psoriasis. In 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved Skilarence((R)) , a new oral formulation of DMF, for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis in need of systemic therapy. Skilarence only contains DMF and is the first FAE for the treatment of psoriasis that has been approved by the EMA. This approval has given rise to a new oral treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis across Europe. Here, we report the results of an expert meeting which was convened to deliver clinician-agreed consensus and real-world guidance on the clinical use of DMF in moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Guidance on appropriate patient selection, DMF dosage considerations, monitoring and side-effect management is offered based upon available evidence and collective real-world clinical experience.

30031662	Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines	Chorioamnionitis	1	0	0	0		Pertussis Immunisation in Pregnancy Safety (PIPS) Study: A retrospective cohort study of safety outcomes in pregnant women vaccinated with Tdap vaccine.	BACKGROUND: New Zealand has funded the administration of tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy to prevent infant pertussis since 2013. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of Tdap vaccine administered to pregnant women as part of a national maternal immunisation programme. METHODS: We conducted a national retrospective observational study using linked administrative New Zealand datasets. The study population consisted of pregnant women eligible to receive funded Tdap vaccination from 28 to 38 weeks gestation in 2013. Primary study outcomes were based on prioritised adverse events for the assessment of vaccine safety in pregnant women, as defined by WHO and Brighton Collaboration taskforces. We examined the effect of Tdap vaccination on prioritised maternal outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. Adjusted hazard ratios controlled for key confounding variables. RESULTS: In the cohort of 68,550 women eligible to receive funded antenatal Tdap vaccination during 2013, 8178 (11.9%) were vaccinated and 60,372 (88.1%) were unvaccinated. The use of Tdap in pregnancy was not associated with an increase in the rate of primary outcomes, including preterm labour; pre-eclampsia; pre-eclampsia with severe features; eclampsia; gestational hypertension; fetal growth restriction; or post-partum haemorrhage. Tdap also did not increase secondary outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus; antenatal bleeding; placental abruption; premature rupture of membranes; preterm delivery; fetal distress; chorioamnionitis; or, maternal fever during or after labour. Lactation disorders was the only secondary maternal outcome with a significantly increased hazard ratio. Tdap vaccine had a protective effect on pre-eclampsia with severe features, preterm labour, preterm delivery, and antenatal bleeding. CONCLUSION: We did not detect any biologically plausible adverse maternal outcomes following Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. This study provides further assurance that Tdap administration during pregnancy is not associated with unexpected safety risks.
30791474	Oxaliplatin	Neuralgia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Phytochemicals of Cinnamomi Cortex: Cinnamic Acid, but not Cinnamaldehyde, Attenuates Oxaliplatin-Induced Cold and Mechanical Hypersensitivity in Rats.	A chemotherapy drug, oxaliplatin, induces cold and mechanical hypersensitivity, but effective treatments for this neuropathic pain without side effects are still lacking. We previously showed that Cinnamomi Cortex suppresses oxaliplatin-induced pain behaviors in rats. However, it remains unknown which phytochemical of Cinnamomi Cortex plays a key role in that analgesic action. Thus, here we investigated whether and how cinnamic acid or cinnamaldehyde, major components of Cinnamomi Cortex, alleviates cold and mechanical allodynia induced by a single oxaliplatin injection (6 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. Using an acetone test and the von Frey test for measuring cold and mechanical allodynia, respectively, we found that administration of cinnamic acid, but not cinnamaldehyde, at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg (i.p.) significantly attenuates the allodynic behaviors in oxaliplatin-injected rats with the strongest effect being observed at 20 mg/kg. Our in vivo extracellular recordings also showed that cinnamic acid (20 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibits the increased activities of spinal wide dynamic range neurons in response to cutaneous mechanical and cold stimuli following the oxaliplatin injection. These results indicate that cinnamic acid has an effective analgesic action against oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain through inhibiting spinal pain transmission, suggesting its crucial role in mediating the effect of Cinnamomi Cortex.

29275962	Ciprofloxacin	Delirium	1	1	0	0	0.0	Fluoroquinolone-Related Neuropsychiatric Events in Hospitalized Veterans.	OBJECTIVE: To measure the incidence and risk factors for fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin)-associated psychosis or delirium in a veteran population. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in the Western New York Veterans Affairs Health System (2005-2013). Participants were hospitalized veterans receiving a fluoroquinolone for at least 48 hours (n = 631). Cases of delirium or psychosis were defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria, and the Naranjo scale (score >/= 1) was used to determine the probability of the adverse drug reaction being related to fluoroquinolones. A bivariate analysis of covariates followed by a multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predisposing factors to the development of delirium/psychosis. RESULTS: The mean age of the population was 71.5 years (range: 22-95). Fluoroquinolone-associated delirium/psychosis occurred in 3.7% of the inpatients studied (n = 23). The median Naranjo score was 3 indicating a possible association. Psychosis/delirium occurred in 3.6% of ciprofloxacin-treated patients (n = 14/391), 4.5% of patients-treated with moxifloxacin (n = 9/200), and 0% of those receiving levofloxacin (n = 0/40); p = 0.4. Significant risk factors for development of delirium/psychosis in patients receiving a fluoroquinolone in the multivariate logistical regression included typical antipsychotic use (OR, 5.4; 95% CI: 1.4-16.7) and age. A 10-year increase in age was associated with a 1.8-fold greater odds of a neuropsychiatric event. CONCLUSIONS: Fluoroquinolones may be more commonly associated with delirium/psychosis than originally reported in this veteran population. Caution should be used when prescribing a fluoroquinolone for patients on typical antipsychotics and those of advanced age.

28561211	Methamphetamine	Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects	1	1	0	0	0.0	[Increasing Consumption of Crystal Meth in Saxony and its Risks for Mother and Child - Experiences at a Level I Perinatal Center from a Pediatric Viewpoint].	"Over the past several years, the number of first-time users of methamphetamine considerably increased within the Free State of Saxony. This number also, and especially, includes women of child-bearing age and young mothers. A supportive intervention aimed at reducing the effects of drug abuse should begin in a timely way - during pregnancy at latest, but better before it. To develop an optimal care protocol for both the mother and her child, more knowledge regarding the personal conditions of the women as well as the specific features of later child development after prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME) is vital. In this study, the data of 129 women and their newborns with PME who were admitted to a Level-1 perinatal center between 2007 and 2015 were analyzed. At delivery, two-thirds of the women were aged 20-30 years. Only 48% attended their first preventive examination in pregnancy within the first 12 weeks. Their children subsequently presented with heterogeneous withdrawal symptoms, and pathological findings of the heart, urogenital and central nervous system. The present data aims to sensitize pediatric and obstetric health professionals to the need for timely and adequate care and support. A pathway model of detoxification treatment for mother and child - ""The Dresden Crystal Path"" - is presented. It combines public and voluntary youth welfare organizations, public health authorities, a public drugs advisory service as well as medical care facilities. Moreover, it describes the coordination of different medical subspecialties such as pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology and psychiatry."

Teriparatide, used for treatment of osteoporosis in patients at high risk of fracture risk, sometimes results in mild and transient hypercalcemia. There have been two recent reports of worsening dystrophic calcification in patients with autoimmune disorders following teriparatide treatment. We report a patient with severe osteoporosis and without a pre-existing autoimmune disorder, who developed symptomatic worsening of dystrophic calcification 4 months after teriparatide was initiated. Symptoms resolved within 1 week of teriparatide cessation.
29720397	Tamoxifen	Long QT Syndrome	1	1	0	0	0.0	Increased long QT and torsade de pointes reporting on tamoxifen compared with aromatase inhibitors.	OBJECTIVE: A prolonged QTc (LQT) is a surrogate for the risk of torsade de pointes (TdP). QTc interval duration is influenced by sex hormones: oestradiol prolongs and testosterone shortens QTc. Drugs used in the treatment of breast cancer have divergent effects on hormonal status. METHODS: We performed a disproportionality analysis using the European database of suspected adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports to evaluate the reporting OR (ROR chi(2)) of LQT, TdP and ventricular arrhythmias associated with selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs: tamoxifen and toremifene) as opposed to aromatase inhibitors (AIs: anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole). When the proportion of an ADR is greater in patients exposed to a drug (SERMs) compared with patients exposed to control drug (AIs), this suggests an association between the specific drug and the reaction and is a potential signal for safety. Clinical and demographic characterisation of patients with SERMs-induced LQT and ventricular arrhythmias was performed. RESULTS: SERMs were associated with higher proportion of LQT reports versus AIs (26/8318 vs 11/14851, ROR: 4.2 (2.11-8.55), p<0.001). SERMs were also associated with higher proportion of TdP and ventricular arrhythmia reports versus AIs (6/8318 vs 2/14851, ROR: 5.4 (1.29-26.15), p:0.02; 16/8318 vs 12/14851, ROR: 2.38 (1.15-4.94), p:0.02, respectively). Mortality was 38% in patients presenting ventricular arrhythmias associated with SERMs. CONCLUSIONS: SERMs are associated with more reports of drug-induced LQT, TdP and ventricular arrhythmias compared with AIs. This finding is consistent with oestradiol-like properties of SERMs on the heart as opposed to effects of oestrogen deprivation and testosterone increase induced by AIs. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03259711.
28817231	Insulin	Hypoglycemia	0	0	0	0		Effect of once-weekly dulaglutide on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose in patient subpopulations by gender, duration of diabetes and baseline HbA1c.	AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dulaglutide 1.5 and 0.75 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes by subgroups of gender, duration of diabetes and baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the dulaglutide clinical development programme (AWARD-1 to -6 and -8 clinical trials). METHODS: Change in HbA1c was analysed by gender, duration of diabetes (<5, >/=5 years and <10, >/=10 years), and baseline HbA1c (<8.5%, >/=8.5%) in pooled and individual studies. Changes from baseline in weight, hypoglycaemia and gastrointestinal adverse events were evaluated for individual trials. RESULTS: In the pooled analysis of patients treated with dulaglutide 1.5 mg at 6 months, the reductions in HbA1c from baseline were similar across gender (men: least squares [LS] mean -1.26% [95% confidence interval CI -1.36, -1.16]; women: LS mean -1.33% [95% CI -1.43, -1.24]) and among duration of diabetes subgroups (<5 years: LS mean -1.32% [95% CI -1.43, -1.22]; >/=5 and <10 years: LS mean -1.33% [95% CI -1.43, -1.22]; >/=10 years: -1.24% [95% CI -1.35, -1.14]). Patients with baseline HbA1c >/=8.5% had greater HbA1c reductions than patients with baseline HbA1c <8.5%, (>/=8.5%: LS mean -1.86% [95% CI -1.97, -1.75]; <8.5%: LS mean -1.02% [95% CI -1.12, -0.93]). Reductions in fasting blood glucose (FBG) were consistent with HbA1c changes. Similar results were observed with dulaglutide 0.75 mg. In general, body weight changes were similar among duration of diabetes and in baseline HbA1c subgroups, respectively; women had a numerically greater weight loss or less weight gain than men with both dulaglutide doses. There was no clinically meaningful difference in hypoglycaemia trends by gender or duration of diabetes. Hypoglycaemia incidence and rate were generally lower in patients with baseline HbA1c >/=8.5% than in those with <8.5%, except for the AWARD-4 study (combination with mealtime insulin). CONCLUSIONS: Across the AWARD studies, dulaglutide demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic control irrespective of gender, duration of diabetes, or baseline HbA1c, with greater HbA1c and FBG reductions in patients with a higher baseline HbA1c. Dulaglutide was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.

30443347	Simvastatin	Musculoskeletal Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Onset timing of statin-induced musculoskeletal adverse events and concomitant drug-associated shift in onset timing of MAEs.	To evaluate the onset timing of musculoskeletal adverse events (MAEs) that develop during statin monotherapy and to determine whether concomitant drugs used concurrently with statin therapy shifts the onset timing of MAEs. Cases in which statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and pravastatin) were prescribed were extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Data Files. The onset timing of MAEs during statin monotherapy was evaluated by determining the difference between statin start date and MAE onset date. The use of concomitant drugs with statin therapy was included in the analysis. Statins used in combination with concomitant drugs were compared with statin monotherapy to determine if the use of concomitant drugs shifted the onset timing of MAEs. The onset of MAEs was significantly faster with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin than with simvastatin. A difference in onset timing was not detected with other statins because the number of cases was too small for analysis. When evaluating concomitant drug use, the concomitant drugs that shifted the onset timing of MAEs could not be detected. Statins with strong low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) contributed not only to a high risk of MAE onset, but also to a shorter time-to-onset. No concomitant drug significantly shifted the onset timing of MAEs when used concurrently with statins.

30566235	Nortriptyline	Dizziness	0	0	0	1		Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	BACKGROUND: Studies report that up to 80% of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may struggle with symptoms of depression. However, this major comorbidity in COPD is rarely managed effectively. A number of recent studies indicate that left untreated, COPD-related depression is associated with worse quality of life, worse compliance with COPD treatment plan, increased exacerbations, hospital admissions, and healthcare costs when compared to individuals with COPD without depression. Regrettably, COPD practice guidelines do not provide conclusive treatment recommendations for the use of antidepressants in patients with COPD, and base their guidelines on findings from trials in the general population. This may be problematic, as there is an elevated risk of respiratory issues associated with antidepressant treatment and COPD. Evaluating effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions specifically for patients with COPD and depression was therefore paramount. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of depression in patients with COPD. SEARCH METHODS: The last search was performed on 26 November 2018. We initially searched the following databases via the Specialised Trials Registers of the Cochrane Airways and Common Mental Disorders Groups (to June 2016): MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, and the Cochrane Library trials register (CENTRAL). Searches from June 2016 to November 2018 were performed directly on Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 26 November 2018. We searched the grey literature databases to identify studies not indexed in major databases and the reference lists of studies initially identified for full-text screening. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of pharmacological interventions with no intervention, placebo or co-intervention in adults with diagnosed COPD and depression were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed articles identified by the search for eligibility. Our primary outcomes were change in depressive symptoms and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were: change in quality of life, change in dyspnoea, change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), change in exercise tolerance, change in hospital utilisation (length of stay and readmission rates), and cost-effectiveness. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the pooled mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as appropriate. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% CI using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1125 records screened for eligibility, four RCTs (N = 201 participants), and one on-going study, met the inclusion criteria. Two classes of antidepressants were investigated in two separate comparisons with placebo: a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).TCA versus placeboOnly one RCT (N = 30 participants) provided results for this comparison.Primary outcomesThe TCA (nortriptyline) reduced depressive symptoms post-treatment compared to placebo (MD -10.20, 95% CI -16.75 to -3.65; P = 0.007; very low-quality evidence), as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Three participants withdrew from the trial due to adverse events related to the tested antidepressant (dry mouth, sedation, orthostatic hypotension).Secondary outcomesThe overall results post-treatment indicated that nortriptyline was not effective in improving the quality of life of individuals with COPD, as measured by the Sickness Impact Profile (MD -2.80, 95% CI -11.02 to 5.42; P = 0.50; very low-quality evidence).The results for the change in dyspnoea for the domains examined (e.g. dyspnoea scores for 'most day-to-day activities') post-treatment showed no improvement in the intervention group (MD 9.80, 95% CI -6.20 to 25.80; P = 0.23; very low-quality evidence).No data were reported for change in FEV(1), change in exercise tolerance, change in hospital utilisation, or cost-effectiveness. The TCA study provided short-term results, with the last follow-up data collection at 12 weeks.The quality of the evidence for all the outcomes evaluated was very low due to a small sample size, imprecision, attrition, and selection and reporting bias.SSRIs versus placeboThree RCTs (N = 171 participants) provided results for this comparison.Primary outcomesThe pooled results for two studies showed no difference for the change in depressive symptoms post-intervention (SMD 0.75, 95% CI -1.14 to 2.64; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.44; very low-quality evidence). High heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 95%), limiting the reliability of these findings.While it was not possible to meta-analyse the total adverse events rates across the studies, it was possible to combine the results for two medication-specific adverse effects: nausea and dizziness. There were no significant post-treatment group differences for nausea (OR 2.32, 95% CI 0.66 to 8.12; 171 participants; 3 studies; P = 0.19; very low-quality evidence) or dizziness (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.06; 143 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.61; very low-quality evidence).Secondary outcomesThe pooled analysis of two trials reporting data for the change in quality of life did not show improvement post-treatment in the intervention group compared to placebo (SMD 1.17, 95% CI -0.80 to 3.15; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.25; very low-quality evidence).There was no difference between groups in change in FEV(1) post-treatment (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.60; low-quality evidence). However, two trials reported improvement in exercise tolerance in the SSRI group versus the placebo group (MD 13.88, 95% CI 11.73 to 16.03; 148 participants; 2 studies; P < 0.001; very low-quality evidence).The trials included in this comparison did not report data related to the change in dyspnoea, hospital utilisation rates, or cost-effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to make definitive statements about the efficacy or safety of antidepressants for treating COPD-related depression. New RCTs are needed; with better methodological quality and more accurate reporting of the methods used. Moreover, longer-term follow-up data collection is needed, including outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and cost-effectiveness.

The TCA study provided short-term results, with the last follow-up data collection at 12 weeks.The quality of the evidence for all the outcomes evaluated was very low due to a small sample size, imprecision, attrition, and selection and reporting bias.SSRIs versus placeboThree RCTs (N = 171 participants) provided results for this comparison.Primary outcomesThe pooled results for two studies showed no difference for the change in depressive symptoms post-intervention (SMD 0.75, 95% CI -1.14 to 2.64; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.44; very low-quality evidence). High heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 95%), limiting the reliability of these findings.While it was not possible to meta-analyse the total adverse events rates across the studies, it was possible to combine the results for two medication-specific adverse effects: nausea and dizziness. There were no significant post-treatment group differences for nausea (OR 2.32, 95% CI 0.66 to 8.12; 171 participants; 3 studies; P = 0.19; very low-quality evidence) or dizziness (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.06; 143 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.61; very low-quality evidence).Secondary outcomesThe pooled analysis of two trials reporting data for the change in quality of life did not show improvement post-treatment in the intervention group compared to placebo (SMD 1.17, 95% CI -0.80 to 3.15; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.25; very low-quality evidence).There was no difference between groups in change in FEV(1) post-treatment (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; 148 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.60; low-quality evidence). However, two trials reported improvement in exercise tolerance in the SSRI group versus the placebo group (MD 13.88, 95% CI 11.73 to 16.03; 148 participants; 2 studies; P < 0.001; very low-quality evidence).The trials included in this comparison did not report data related to the change in dyspnoea, hospital utilisation rates, or cost-effectiveness. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to make definitive statements about the efficacy or safety of antidepressants for treating COPD-related depression. New RCTs are needed; with better methodological quality and more accurate reporting of the methods used. Moreover, longer-term follow-up data collection is needed, including outcomes such as adverse events, hospital utilisation and cost-effectiveness.
30566235	Paroxetine	Nausea	0	0	0	1		Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	BACKGROUND: Studies report that up to 80% of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may struggle with symptoms of depression. However, this major comorbidity in COPD is rarely managed effectively. A number of recent studies indicate that left untreated, COPD-related depression is associated with worse quality of life, worse compliance with COPD treatment plan, increased exacerbations, hospital admissions, and healthcare costs when compared to individuals with COPD without depression. Regrettably, COPD practice guidelines do not provide conclusive treatment recommendations for the use of antidepressants in patients with COPD, and base their guidelines on findings from trials in the general population. This may be problematic, as there is an elevated risk of respiratory issues associated with antidepressant treatment and COPD. Evaluating effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions specifically for patients with COPD and depression was therefore paramount. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of depression in patients with COPD. SEARCH METHODS: The last search was performed on 26 November 2018. We initially searched the following databases via the Specialised Trials Registers of the Cochrane Airways and Common Mental Disorders Groups (to June 2016): MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, and the Cochrane Library trials register (CENTRAL). Searches from June 2016 to November 2018 were performed directly on Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the ISRCTN registry, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 26 November 2018. We searched the grey literature databases to identify studies not indexed in major databases and the reference lists of studies initially identified for full-text screening. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of pharmacological interventions with no intervention, placebo or co-intervention in adults with diagnosed COPD and depression were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed articles identified by the search for eligibility. Our primary outcomes were change in depressive symptoms and adverse events. The secondary outcomes were: change in quality of life, change in dyspnoea, change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), change in exercise tolerance, change in hospital utilisation (length of stay and readmission rates), and cost-effectiveness. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the pooled mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as appropriate. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% CI using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1125 records screened for eligibility, four RCTs (N = 201 participants), and one on-going study, met the inclusion criteria.

AIMS: To test the hypothesis that, as well as lowering weight and increasing plasma triglyceride (TG) levels and hepatic fat compared with insulin glargine (GL) in patients with type 1 diabetes, the attenuated peripheral effects of basal insulin peglispro (BIL) may include increased free fatty acid flux to the liver, causing increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG secretion and lipid oxidation, and decreased TG adipose tissue deposition. METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study, 14 patients with type 1 diabetes received once-daily, individualized, stable BIL or GL doses for 3 weeks. Palmitate flux was assessed using [9,10-(3) H]palmitate infusion. VLDL-TG secretion, clearance and oxidation rate were assessed using primed-constant infusion of ex vivo labelled [1-(14) C]VLDL-TG, while VLDL-TG storage rate was assessed using [9,10-(3) H]VLDL-TG bolus injection. RESULTS: The VLDL-TG concentration and secretion rate, and palmitate flux were statistically significantly higher during BIL than during GL treatment (58%, 51% and 35%, respectively). The ratios of least squares (LS) geometric means for VLDL-TG clearance and oxidation were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72, 1.17) and 1.31 (95% CI 0.91, 1.90), respectively. The difference in LS means for VLDL-TG storage rate was -0.36 (95% CI -0.83, 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: BIL-treated patients had higher effective lipolysis, VLDL-TG secretion and VLDL-TG concentration compared with GL-treated patients, explaining the increased plasma TG concentrations reported previously. Data support attenuated effects of BIL on lipolysis, in addition to the recently described hepato-preferential glucodynamic effects.

AIMS: To test the hypothesis that, as well as lowering weight and increasing plasma triglyceride (TG) levels and hepatic fat compared with insulin glargine (GL) in patients with type 1 diabetes, the attenuated peripheral effects of basal insulin peglispro (BIL) may include increased free fatty acid flux to the liver, causing increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG secretion and lipid oxidation, and decreased TG adipose tissue deposition. METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study, 14 patients with type 1 diabetes received once-daily, individualized, stable BIL or GL doses for 3 weeks. Palmitate flux was assessed using [9,10-(3) H]palmitate infusion. VLDL-TG secretion, clearance and oxidation rate were assessed using primed-constant infusion of ex vivo labelled [1-(14) C]VLDL-TG, while VLDL-TG storage rate was assessed using [9,10-(3) H]VLDL-TG bolus injection. RESULTS: The VLDL-TG concentration and secretion rate, and palmitate flux were statistically significantly higher during BIL than during GL treatment (58%, 51% and 35%, respectively). The ratios of least squares (LS) geometric means for VLDL-TG clearance and oxidation were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72, 1.17) and 1.31 (95% CI 0.91, 1.90), respectively. The difference in LS means for VLDL-TG storage rate was -0.36 (95% CI -0.83, 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: BIL-treated patients had higher effective lipolysis, VLDL-TG secretion and VLDL-TG concentration compared with GL-treated patients, explaining the increased plasma TG concentrations reported previously. Data support attenuated effects of BIL on lipolysis, in addition to the recently described hepato-preferential glucodynamic effects.

30304106	Metformin	Hypoglycemia	0	0	0	0		Dapagliflozin versus saxagliptin as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin.	OBJECTIVE: This analysis compared the efficacy and safety of the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, dapagliflozin, and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, saxagliptin, both added on to metformin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis from a double-blind, randomized, 24-week clinical trial (NCT01606007) of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled with metformin. We compared the dapagliflozin 10 mg (n = 179) and saxagliptin 5 mg (n = 176) treatment arms. RESULTS: Dapagliflozin showed significantly greater mean reductions versus saxagliptin in HbA1c (difference versus saxagliptin [95% CI]: -0.32% [-0.54, -0.10]; p < 0.005), fasting plasma glucose (-0.98 [-1.42, -0.54] mmol/L; p < 0.0001), body weight (-2.39 [-3.08, -1.71] kg; p < 0.0001) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-3.89 [-6.15, -1.63] mmHg; p < 0.001). More dapagliflozintreated than saxagliptin-treated patients achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c reduction >/= 0.5%, weight loss >/= 2 kg, SBP reduction >/= 2 mmHg and no major/minor hypoglycemia (24% versus 7%). No major events of hypoglycemia were reported. More patients on dapagliflozin (6%) versus saxagliptin (0.6%) experienced genital infections. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin demonstrated greater glycemic efficacy than saxagliptin with additional benefits on weight and SBP, and the safety profile was consistent with previous studies.
30121852	Cyclophosphamide	Lung Injury	1	1	0	0	0.0	Radiologic evaluation of pulmonary injury following carmustine- and cyclophosphamide-based preparative regimen for autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in children.	BACKGROUND: Toxicity of carmustine and cyclophosphamide can cause pulmonary injury after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the radiologic findings of pulmonary injuries following carmustine- and cyclophosphamide-based preparative regimens in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2010 to 2014, 35 children received carmustine- and cyclophosphamide-based preparative regimens. Fourteen of 35 children presented with symptoms and radiologic abnormalities. Eight of 14 children had no evidence of infection, cardiogenic edema, or other explainable causes. We retrospectively analyzed their chest radiographs and CT scans for ground-glass opacity, consolidation, septal thickening and pleural effusion. RESULTS: Major chest radiographic findings were bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacity (n=8) and septal thickening (n=7). CT findings were multifocal patchy (n=4) or inhomogeneously diffuse (n=4) ground-glass opacity, multifocal consolidations (n=7) and septal thickening (n=7). All of these lesions at CT were bilateral, but showed lower lobe predominance in 88, 100, and 63%, respectively. There was no central/peripheral or anterior/posterior predilection. Six children had small pleural effusions, which were bilateral in five children. CONCLUSION: Bilateral ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation, septal thickening and pleural effusion were common radiologic findings in pulmonary injury following carmustine- and cyclophosphamide-based preparative regimens.
29134721	Loratadine	Tooth Erosion	0	1	0	0		ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and mu-EDXRF spectrometry monitoring of enamel erosion caused by medicaments used in the treatment of respiratory diseases.	Medicaments essential for alleviation of diseases may sometime adversely affect dental health by eroding the enamel, owing to their acidic nature. It is therefore highly desirable to be able to detect these effects quickly and reliably. In this study, we evaluated the erosive capacity of four most commonly prescribed respiratory disease syrup medicaments on enamel using micro-energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (micro-EDXRF) and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Fifty-five enamel fragments obtained from 30 bovine teeth were treated with artificial saliva (S), acebrofilin hydrochloride (AC), ambroxol hydrochloride (AM), bromhexine hydrochloride (BR), and salbutamol sulfate (SS); by immersing in 3 mL of respective solutions for 1 min, three times a day at intervals of 1 hr, for 5 days. micro-EDXRF analysis of enamel surface did not reveal significant erosion caused by the medications. However, ATR-FTIR showed a detectable shift in the phosphate (PO(4) ) antisymmetric stretching mode (nu(3) ) at  approximately 985 cm(-1) for AM, BR, and SS, indicating erosion. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that AC, AM, SS, and BR could be classified with 70%, 80%, 100%, and 100% efficiency from S (control), further highlighting the ability of ATR-FTIR to identify degree of erosion. This suggests ATR-FTIR may be used to rapidly and nondestructively investigate erosive effects of medicaments.
29425544	Ranibizumab	Thrombosis	0	1	0	0		Ranibizumab and digital ischemia.	Case report of a patient with age-related macular degeneration whose digital ischemia can most plausibly be attributed to ranibizumab. PURPOSE: To report ranibizumab as the probable cause of digital ischemia in a patient treated for age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: Single-patient case report. RESULTS: An 83-year-old woman with an unremarkable medical history suffered acute ischemia in her left hand with necrosis of the distal phalange of the fifth finger after six intravitreal injections of ranibizumab. Her etiological work-up was negative. Her condition improved after endovascular revascularization and remained good at six months' follow-up after three months of dual antithrombotic therapy (low molecular weight heparin then rivaroxaban, both with aspirin) followed by rivaroxaban alone and four courses of intravenous iloprost. CONCLUSION: The increased incidence of peripheral arterial thromboembolic events in patients under ranibizumab treatment is slight but significant, with 0.8-5% of patients affected, most of which suffer strokes. These events seem to occur at a random time after ranibizumab treatment is initiated and no reliable marker has yet been identified. The most probable cause of digital ischemia in our patient was ranibizumab.
28862347	Hydroxyethyl Starch Derivatives	Acute Kidney Injury	0	0	0	0		Effects of Hydroxyethyl Starch 130/0.4 on Serum Creatinine Concentration and Development of Acute Kidney Injury in Nonazotemic Cats.	BACKGROUND: Hydroxyethyl-starch (HES) solutions might have renal adverse effects in humans and dogs. OBJECTIVE: To determine if administration of 6% HES-130/0.4 is associated with an increase in serum creatinine concentration and development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in nonazotemic cats. ANIMALS: A total of 62 critically ill cats; 26 HES exposed and 36 unexposed. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study (2012-2015). Serum creatinine concentrations were recorded and changes in serum creatinine concentrations before exposure (baseline) and 2-10 and 11-90 days, respectively, were determined. Development of AKI was defined as a > 150% increase or >26 mumol/L increase in serum creatinine concentration from baseline. Risk factors, such as HES administration, cumulative volume of HES (mL/kg) and number of days of HES administration leading to development of AKI, and change in serum creatinine were analyzed. RESULTS: Cats in the HES cohort received a mean volume of 98.5 +/- 76.2 mL/kg (range, 8-278 mL/kg) HES over a median of 4 (range, 1-11) days, resulting in a median dose of 20.1 (range, 8-40.5) mL/kg per day. Short-term %change in serum creatinine concentration (P = 0.40) and development of AKI (P = 0.32) were not significantly different between cohorts. Multivariable logistic regression did not identify HES dose in mL/kg (P = 0.33) and number of days of HES application (P = 0.49) as a risk factor for development of AKI. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Hydroxyethyl-starch administration to critically ill nonazotemic cats seems to be safe. A larger prospective study is required to determine the effect of HES administration at higher dosages and for prolonged time periods.

29509526	Ephedrine	Coronary Vasospasm	1	1	0	0	0.0	Recurrent Coronary Artery Spasm Induced by Vasopressors During Two Operations in the Same Patient Under General Anesthesia.	Variant angina is caused by coronary artery spasm (CAS) with ST-segment elevation. We herein report a case of recurrent CAS during 2 operations in the same patient. An 80-year-old woman was scheduled to undergo tracheostomy, submandibular dissection, left partial maxillectomy, and coronoidectomy. We administered ephedrine and phenylephrine to manage hypotension during general anesthesia. Immediately after the administration of these drugs, the ST segment elevated. We decided to cease the operation and transport the patient to the department of cardiology. Computed tomography angiography revealed pneumomediastinum. The cardiologists considered that the electrocardiography findings had changed secondary to pneumomediastinum. About 6 weeks later, a second operation was scheduled. We administered ephedrine and phenylephrine to manage hypotension during general anesthesia. Immediately after the administration of these drugs, ST-segment elevation occurred. We discontinued use of these drugs, and the ST-segment elevation did not recur. We considered that the cause of the ST-segment elevation was vasopressor-induced CAS because the vasopressors were administered immediately before the occurrence of CAS. Vasopressors such as ephedrine or phenylephrine are frequently used to manage hypotension during general anesthesia. Therefore, anesthesiologists should consider the occurrence of CAS before using vasopressors and know how to manage CAS well.

BACKGROUND: Acne vulgaris (acne) is the most common skin disease in patients who have darker skin with most frequent sequelae of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). METHODS: Open label study in 20 patients (mean age 32 years) with Fitzpatrick Skin Type V or VI and with moderate facial acne treated with clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/benzoyl peroxide 3.75% gel (CL-BP 3.75%) once-daily for 16 weeks. Assessments included improvement in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of acne severity, PIH severity and distribution, and lesion count reduction. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed throughout. RESULTS: Significant reductions in inflammatory, noninflammatory and total lesions occurred within the first 4 weeks compared to baseline. At week 16, percent changes from baseline were 76%, 62%, and 71%, respectively (all P less than equal to .0002). There was also a significant reduction in IGA to week 16 (P equals.0001); 70% (N=14) of patients were 'clear' or 'almost clear' and all patients experienced at least a 1-grade improvement in IGA. Additionally, PIH severity and distribution were also significantly reduced by week 16. In 40% of patients PIH severity was rated as 'none' or 'slight'; 19 (95%) and 15 (75%) of patients experienced at least a 1-grade improvement in PIH severity or distribution. Ten patients experienced a total of 21 AEs. There were no serious AEs. Only one AE was possibly related to study drug (facial tattoo tightening) and resolved with no residual effects at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Fitzpatrick Skin Type V and VI treated with clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/ benzoyl peroxide 3.75% gel experienced significant reductions in facial acne severity, lesion counts and PIH severity/distribution. Tolerability was excellent. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(10):1107-1112.
30062489	Methionine	Hyperhomocysteinemia	0	1	0	0		Diet-induced hyperhomocysteinemia impairs vasodilation in 5/6-nephrectomized rats.	Plasma homocysteine is elevated in patients with impaired renal function, and markedly so at end-stage renal disease. As chronic kidney disease and hyperhomocysteinemia are also independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the latter is hypothesized to accelerate vascular abnormalities following renal failure. This study aimed to investigate the combined effect of impaired renal function and hyperhomocysteinemia on vascular function. We show that in 5/6-nephrectomized rats, a model of chronic kidney disease, a methionine-rich diet for 8 weeks induces moderate hyperhomocysteinemia, exacerbates hypertension, and attenuates the vascular response to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, 8-bromo-cGMP, and isoprenaline. However, plasma nitrate/nitrite and total NOS activity in the thoracic aorta were not affected. Collectively, the data imply that hyperhomocysteinemia and end-stage renal disease synergistically impair endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation by blocking the cGMP/protein kinase G and/or cAMP/protein kinase A pathways. 5/6-Nephrectomized rat with hyperhomocysteinemia induced by a methionine-rich diet would be a useful model for elucidating the pathogenesis of vascular impairment in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Infections that can arise during glucocorticoid use, and for which preventative measures can be taken, include reactivation of latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B, pneumococcal and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, influenza, herpes zoster and Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome. The risk of such infections depends upon the duration of glucocorticoid use and dosage, as well as comorbidity and comedication. It is important to enquire about vaccinations, travel, exposure and previous infections when taking a case history. Possible infectious complications should be considered in patients who are receiving high-dose glucocorticoids treatment amounting to more than 420 mg PED per 4 weeks. Preventative measures are not usually required in patients who receive a short high-dosed treatment (30 mg PED in 7 days) or prednisolone at a dosage of < 15 mg/day.

30212012	Valproic Acid	Muscle Weakness	1	1	0	0	0.0	[Valproic acid toxicity due to misinterpretation of plasma levels: increase in unbound fraction caused by hypoalbuminaemia and renal dysfunction].	BACKGROUND: Valproic acid is one of the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. As only the unbound fraction of a medicinal product is pharmacologically active, in some strong protein-bound psychotropic drugs such as valproic acid and phenytoin, a rise in this fraction can lead to severe toxicity. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 65-year-old male with a type 1 bipolar disorder developed a number of neurological symptoms including sluggishness, muscle weakness, difficulty in walking and disorders of micturition after his mood stabiliser was changed to valproic acid. Recognition of drug toxicity was delayed as his total plasma valproic acid levels were within the therapeutic range. Later it became apparent that the patient had toxic unbound valproic acid levels due to hypoalbuminaemia and impaired renal function. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should always consider drug toxicity in patients who show neurological symptoms and use highly protein-bound psychotropic drugs, even if the total plasma concentration of the drug is in the therapeutic range.

28934061	Meningococcal Vaccines	Guillain-Barre Syndrome	0	0	0	1		Current safety issues with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines.	Invasive meningococcal disease, although rare, can present as sudden, life-threatening disease with high risk of mortality or severe long-term sequelae. The main prevention strategy for invasive meningococcal disease in the United States is the routine vaccination of adolescents and other persons at increased risk of meningococcal disease with quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines. Two such vaccines are currently licensed and available in the United States, Menactra(R) (Sanofi Pasteur) and Menveo(R) (GlaxoSmithKline), and usage in the adolescent population has steadily increased since their introduction. Although early reports raised concerns about a possible association of Menactra with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a comprehensive safety review determined that if such risk existed it was no more than 0.66 cases per 1 million vaccinations. More recently, a study found an elevated risk of Bell's palsy when Menveo was administered concomitantly with other vaccines but no association was found when the vaccine was administered alone. In this commentary, we describe the current state of knowledge with respect to the safety of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines, and we identify potential areas for safety research for these vaccines.
29274030	Sunitinib	Fatigue	1	1	0	0	0.0	Fatigue among patients with renal cell carcinoma receiving adjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib: patient-reported outcomes of ECOG-ACRIN E2805 trial.	BACKGROUND: E2805 was a phase III trial to test whether adjuvant sunitinib or sorafenib could improve disease-free survival compared to placebo in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Patient-reported outcomes (PRO), focusing on fatigue, were evaluated as a secondary endpoint. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 463 patients participated in the PRO study. Fatigue was measured by the FACIT Fatigue scale and PROMIS Fatigue SF1 measure at baseline, week 10, and week 22. The primary endpoint was change in fatigue score from baseline to week 22, measured by the FACIT Fatigue scale. Secondarily, the psychometric properties of PROMIS Fatigue SF1 were assessed in relation to the FACIT Fatigue scale. RESULTS: Fatigue got significantly worse on all arms after 2 cycles of treatment, and especially so in patients on sunitinib (- 9.6 vs. - 5.6 on sorafenib vs. - 4.7 on placebo). Fatigue remained stable during week 10 and week 22. Overall, the mean score change between baseline and week 22 was - 7.9 (p < 0.001) on sunitinib, - 6.4 (p < 0.001) on sorafenib and - 5.6 (p < 0.001) on placebo arm. The difference in score change was not statistically significant between the two experimental arms and the placebo arm (difference = - 2.34 [p = 0.110] and - 0.87 [p = 0.535] for sunitinib vs. placebo and sorafenib vs. placebo). PROMIS Fatigue SF1 had good internal consistency reliability and construct and criterion validity, and was highly correlated with the FACIT Fatigue scale score. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue got worse during study period, especially in patients on sunitinib. The PROMIS Fatigue SF1 was highly correlated with FACIT Fatigue and produced similar results.
30207920	Fingolimod Hydrochloride	Headache	0	0	0	0		Trial of Fingolimod versus Interferon Beta-1a in Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis.	BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients younger than 18 years of age with multiple sclerosis has not been adequately examined in randomized trials. We compared fingolimod with interferon beta-1a in this population. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients 10 to 17 years of age with relapsing multiple sclerosis in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral fingolimod at a dose of 0.5 mg per day (0.25 mg per day for patients with a body weight of </=40 kg) or intramuscular interferon beta-1a at a dose of 30 mug per week for up to 2 years. The primary end point was the annualized relapse rate. RESULTS: Of a total of 215 patients, 107 were assigned to fingolimod and 108 to interferon beta-1a. The mean age of the patients was 15.3 years. Among all patients, there was a mean of 2.4 relapses during the preceding 2 years. The adjusted annualized relapse rate was 0.12 with fingolimod and 0.67 with interferon beta-1a (absolute difference, 0.55 relapses; relative difference, 82%; P<0.001). The key secondary end point of the annualized rate of new or newly enlarged lesions on T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was 4.39 with fingolimod and 9.27 with interferon beta-1a (absolute difference, 4.88 lesions; relative difference, 53%; P<0.001). Adverse events, excluding relapses of multiple sclerosis, occurred in 88.8% of patients who received fingolimod and 95.3% of those who received interferon beta-1a. Serious adverse events occurred in 18 patients (16.8%) in the fingolimod group and included seizures (in 4 patients), infection (in 4 patients), and leukopenia (in 2 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 7 patients (6.5%) in the interferon beta-1a group and included infection (in 2 patients) and supraventricular tachycardia (in 1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: Among pediatric patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, fingolimod was associated with a lower rate of relapse and less accumulation of lesions on MRI over a 2-year period than interferon beta-1a but was associated with a higher rate of serious adverse events. Longer studies are required to determine the durability and safety of fingolimod in pediatric multiple sclerosis. (Funded by Novartis Pharma; PARADIGMS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01892722 .).

The primary end point was the annualized relapse rate. RESULTS: Of a total of 215 patients, 107 were assigned to fingolimod and 108 to interferon beta-1a. The mean age of the patients was 15.3 years. Among all patients, there was a mean of 2.4 relapses during the preceding 2 years. The adjusted annualized relapse rate was 0.12 with fingolimod and 0.67 with interferon beta-1a (absolute difference, 0.55 relapses; relative difference, 82%; P<0.001). The key secondary end point of the annualized rate of new or newly enlarged lesions on T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was 4.39 with fingolimod and 9.27 with interferon beta-1a (absolute difference, 4.88 lesions; relative difference, 53%; P<0.001). Adverse events, excluding relapses of multiple sclerosis, occurred in 88.8% of patients who received fingolimod and 95.3% of those who received interferon beta-1a. Serious adverse events occurred in 18 patients (16.8%) in the fingolimod group and included seizures (in 4 patients), infection (in 4 patients), and leukopenia (in 2 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 7 patients (6.5%) in the interferon beta-1a group and included infection (in 2 patients) and supraventricular tachycardia (in 1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: Among pediatric patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis, fingolimod was associated with a lower rate of relapse and less accumulation of lesions on MRI over a 2-year period than interferon beta-1a but was associated with a higher rate of serious adverse events. Longer studies are required to determine the durability and safety of fingolimod in pediatric multiple sclerosis. (Funded by Novartis Pharma; PARADIGMS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01892722 .).

BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients younger than 18 years of age with multiple sclerosis has not been adequately examined in randomized trials. We compared fingolimod with interferon beta-1a in this population. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients 10 to 17 years of age with relapsing multiple sclerosis in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral fingolimod at a dose of 0.5 mg per day (0.25 mg per day for patients with a body weight of </=40 kg) or intramuscular interferon beta-1a at a dose of 30 mug per week for up to 2 years.

29181880	Titanium	Gingivitis	0	0	0	0		Histological evaluations and inflammatory responses of different dental implant abutment materials: A human histology pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Improvements of soft tissue to the abutment surface results in more stable peri-implant conditions, however, few human histological studies have compared soft tissue responses around different abutment materials. PURPOSE: To describe the peri-implant tissue around 3 abutment materials; titanium, zirconia, and gold alloy, over an 8-week healing period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen edentulous sites were treated with implants. Eight weeks later, peri-implant tissue was harvested and processed using a nonseparation resin embedded technique. The tissue attachment characteristics were assessed at clinical stages using the gingival index (GI) score, surgical stage (surgical score), and histological stage (histological attachment percentage). Additionally, the inflammatory responses were evaluated using inflammatory extent and inflammatory cellularity grades. Nonparametrical statistics were used to describe the GI and surgical scores, and analytical statistics were used to analyze the histological attachment percentages as well as the inflammatory extent and cellularity grades amongst the 3 groups. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences among the groups for GI score (P = .071) and surgical score (P = .262). Titanium and zirconia exhibited nearly similar mean histological attachment percentages while gold alloy had a significantly lower percentage (P = .004). For the inflammatory extent and cellularity grades, the odds of being one grade higher for gold alloy abutment was 5.18 and 17.8 times that of titanium abutment, respectively. However, for the zirconia abutment, the odds were 0.87 and 7.5 times higher than the titanium group. CONCLUSIONS: The tissue around the gold alloy abutments resulted in worse attachment conditions compared with the titanium and zirconia abutments. Inflammation tended to be higher in the tissue around the gold alloy abutments than the titanium and zirconia abutments.
29974459	Neostigmine	Postoperative Complications	0	0	0	0		Implementation of a new strategy to improve the peri-operative management of neuromuscular blockade and its effects on postoperative pulmonary complications.	Inappropriate dosing of neostigmine for antagonism of neuromuscular blockade has been associated with postoperative pulmonary complications. We evaluated the effects of a quality improvement initiative tailored to optimise the use of neostigmine in antagonising neuromuscular blockade on postoperative pulmonary complications, costs and duration of hospital stay. The quality improvement initiative consisted of: a reduction in available neostigmine aliquot sizes; a cognitive aid; an educational component; and a financial incentive for the intra-operative documentation of train-of-four measurement before administration of neostigmine. We conducted a pre-specified analysis of data obtained in our quality improvement study. Additional analyses were conducted in a propensity-matched cohort. An interrupted time series design was used to discriminate between the intervention and a counterfactual scenario. We analysed 12,025 consecutive surgical cases performed in 2015. Postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 220 (7.5%) of 2937 cases pre-intervention and 568 (6.3%) of 9088 cases post-intervention. Adjusted regression analyses showed significantly a lower risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 0.73 (95%CI 0.61-0.88); p = 0.001), lower costs (incidence rate ratio 0.95 (95%CI 0.93-0.97); p < 0.001) and shorter duration of hospital stay (incidence rate ratio 0.91 (95%CI 0.87-0.94); p < 0.001) after implementation of the quality improvement initiative. Analyses in a propensity-matched sample (n = 2936 per group) and interrupted time series analysis (n = 27,202 cases) confirmed the findings. Our data show that a local, multifaceted quality improvement initiative can enhance the quality of intra-operative neuromuscular blocking agent utilisation, thereby reducing the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications.
28913596	Methotrexate	Surgical Wound Infection	0	0	0	0		[Perioperative management of immunosuppressive treatment in patients undergoing joint surgery].	The perioperative management of patients on immunosuppressive drugs is uncertain due to a lack of controlled studies. Continuation of medication without a pause may increase the risk of postoperative infections and wound healing disorders and when the pause is too long this can induce a flare of the underlying rheumatic disease. Additional factors, such as rheumatic disease activity, comorbidities, previous infections and the type of surgical procedure also modulate the risk. The highest risk of infection is associated with corticosteroids depending on the dose, so that a dosage as low as possible but stable in the perioperative period is recommended. Among the conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) only methotrexate has been sufficiently investigated and in this case a pause in treatment induces higher risks than continuation. Antimalarial agents and sulphasalazine should be continued due to the low risks, whereas leflunomide should be washed out before major surgical interventions. The perioperative risk of treatment with biologics is still far from clear; therefore, as a rule of thumb, withholding treatment for two serum half-lives before an intervention and restarting after completed wound healing are recommended.
28542914	Isotretinoin	Eye Diseases	1	0	0	0		Efficacy and adverse events of oral isotretinoin for acne: a systematic review.	Despite many years of clinical use of isotretinoin, a comprehensive review of evidence for isotretinoin therapy in patients with acne is lacking. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, relevant web pages and bibliographies for randomized controlled trials in acne evaluating isotretinoin vs. control (placebo or other therapy). Data were extracted and summarized descriptively. Eleven trials were identified (total 760 patients randomized), containing mostly men. Mean treatment ages ranged from 18 to 47.9 years and participants generally had moderate-to-severe acne. Across all trials, isotretinoin therapy reduced acne lesion counts by a clinically relevant amount, and always by a greater amount than control, which was either placebo (two studies), oral antibiotics (seven studies) or other control (two studies). Across trials with an overall low risk of bias, two of three demonstrated statistically significant differences between isotretinoin and control. The frequency of adverse events was twice as high with isotretinoin (751 events) than with control (388 events). More than half of all adverse events were dermatological and related to dryness. Adverse events from isotretinoin causing participant withdrawal from trials (12 patients) included Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cheilitis, xerosis, acne flare, photophobia, elevated liver enzymes, decreased appetite, headaches and depressed mood. This review suggests that isotretinoin is effective in reducing acne lesion counts, but adverse events are common. This study was registered with PROSPERO number CRD42015025080.

30326737	Tenofovir	Kidney Diseases	0	1	0	0		Mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis and necrosis contribute to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-induced renal damage in rats.	Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is currently the only nucleotide analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitor that is approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA), USA, for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In recent days, renal toxicity is becoming common i HIV patients treated with TDF. However, the mechanism of tenofovir nephrotoxicity is not clear. We hypothesized that mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP) overactivation and neutrophil infiltration may contribute to tenofovir-induced renal damage. Renal damage was induced in adult male Wistar rats by the oral administration of 600 mg/kg body weight daily for five consecutive weeks. Kidneys were removed and used for histological and biochemical analyses. Apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay and caspase 3 activity and protein expression; mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by cyt c release; and PARP activation by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western blot techniques. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured as a marker of neutrophil infiltration. TDF administration resulted in increased number of TUNEL-positive cells, activation of caspase 3 and release of cyt c from mitochondria into the cytosol in the kidneys. There was increased nuclear localization of PARP as well as increase in its protein level in the TDF-treated rat kidneys. In addition, renal MPO activity was increased ninefold as compared to controls. The results of the present study show that mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, PARP overactivation and neutrophil infiltration contribute to tenofovir-induced renal damage in rats.
28471252	Gold	Hypersensitivity, Delayed	1	1	0	0	0.0	Type IV Hypersensitivity to Gold Weight Upper-Eyelid Implant: Case Report and Review of the Literature.	PURPOSE: Complications associated with gold-weight insertion for lagophthalmos are uncommon, recent reports have provided evidence to suggest that type IV hypersensitivity to gold can cause a persistent inflammatory reaction. METHODS: We present a case of a 46-year-old man who experienced persistent post-operative inflammation, and summarize previously documented cases. This patient underwent uncomplicated insertion of an upper eyelid gold weight for right-sided facial nerve palsy. He had no allergies or implanted metalwork. Post-operatively erythema was noted at seven-weeks and did not resolve. The weight was removed after six-months. RESULTS: The histopathological findings were in keeping with type IV hypersensitivity and similar to previous cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although infrequent, this complication has poor outcomes. The definitive management is removal of the weight. Information regarding implanted gold, and previous reactions should be elicited pre-operatively. Type IV hypersensitivity should be considered in patients with persistent inflammation that do not respond to antibiotic or steroid therapy.
30044117	Ketamine	Hypoxia	0	0	0	0		Arterial pH and blood gas values in rats under three types of general anesthesia: a chronobiological study.	The aim of study was to review the status of arterial pH, pO(2) and pCO(2) under general anesthesias in dependence on the light-dark (LD) cycle in spontaneously breathing rats. The experiments were performed using three- to four-month-old pentobarbital(P)-, ketamine/xylazine(K/X)- and zoletil(Z)-anesthetized female Wistar rats after a four-week adaptation to an LD cycle (12 h light:12 h dark). The animals were divided into three experimental groups according to the anesthetic agent used: P (light n=11; dark n=8); K/X (light n=13; dark n=11); and Z (light n=18; dark n=26). pH and blood gases from arterial blood were analyzed. In P anesthesia, LD differences in pH, pO(2), and pCO(2) were eliminated. In K/X anesthesia, parameters showed significant LD differences. In Z anesthesia, LD differences were detected for pH and pO(2) only. Acidosis, hypoxia, and hypercapnia have been reported for all types of anesthesia during the light period. In the dark period, except for P anesthesia, the environment was more stable and values fluctuated within normal ranges. From a chronobiological perspective, P anesthesia was not the most appropriate type of anesthesia in these rat experiments. It eliminated LD differences, and also produced a more acidic environment and more pronounced hypercapnia than K/X and Z anesthesias.

29878256	Alemtuzumab	Thyroid Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Alemtuzumab-Induced Thyroid Dysfunction Exhibits Distinctive Clinical and Immunological Features.	CONTEXT: Alemtuzumab, a highly effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS), predisposes to Graves disease (GD), with a reportedly indolent course. OBJECTIVE: To determine the type, frequency, and course of thyroid dysfunction (TD) in a cohort of alemtuzumab-treated patients with MS in the United Kingdom. DESIGN: Case records of alemtuzumab-treated patients who developed TD were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 41.1% (102 out of 248; 80 female and 22 male) of patients developed TD, principally GD (71.6%). Median onset was 17 months (range 2 to 107) following the last dose, with the majority (89%) within 3 years. Follow-up data (range 6 to 251 months) were available in 71 case subjects, of whom 52 (73.2%) developed GD: 10 of these (19.2%) had fluctuating TD. All 52 patients with GD commenced antithyroid drugs (ATDs): 3 required radioiodine (RAI) due to ATD side effects, and drug therapy is ongoing in 2; of those who completed a course, 16 are in remission, 1 developed spontaneous hypothyroidism, and 30 (64%) required definitive or long-term treatment (RAI, n = 17; thyroidectomy, n = 5; and long-term ATDs, n = 8). Three cases of thyroiditis and 16 cases of hypothyroidism were documented: 5 with antithyroid peroxidase antibody positivity only, 10 with positive TSH receptor antibody (TRAb), and 1 of uncertain etiology. Bioassay confirmed both stimulating and blocking TRAb in a subset of fluctuating GD cases. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to published literature, we recorded frequent occurrence of GD that required definitive or prolonged ATD treatment. Furthermore, fluctuating thyroid status in GD and unexpectedly high frequency of TRAb-positive hypothyroidism suggested changing activity of TRAb in this clinical context; we have documented the existence of both blocking and stimulating TRAb in these patients.
29384700	Nicotine	Inflammation	0	1	0	0		Chronic inhalation of e-cigarette vapor containing nicotine disrupts airway barrier function and induces systemic inflammation and multiorgan fibrosis in mice.	Electronic (e)-cigarettes theoretically may be safer than conventional tobacco. However, our prior studies demonstrated direct adverse effects of e-cigarette vapor (EV) on airway cells, including decreased viability and function. We hypothesize that repetitive, chronic inhalation of EV will diminish airway barrier function, leading to inflammatory protein release into circulation, creating a systemic inflammatory state, ultimately leading to distant organ injury and dysfunction. C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice underwent nose only EV exposure daily for 3-6 mo, followed by cardiorenal physiological testing. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were grown at an air-liquid interface and exposed to EV for 15 min daily for 3-5 days before functional testing. Daily inhalation of EV increased circulating proinflammatory and profibrotic proteins in both C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice: the greatest increases observed were in angiopoietin-1 (31-fold) and EGF (25-fold). Proinflammatory responses were recapitulated by daily EV exposures in vitro of human airway epithelium, with EV epithelium secreting higher IL-8 in response to infection (227 vs. 37 pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). Chronic EV inhalation in vivo reduced renal filtration by 20% ( P = 0.017). Fibrosis, assessed by Masson's trichrome and Picrosirius red staining, was increased in EV kidneys (1.86-fold, C57BL/6; 3.2-fold, CD-1; P < 0.05), heart (2.75-fold, C57BL/6 mice; P < 0.05), and liver (1.77-fold in CD-1; P < 0.0001). Gene expression changes demonstrated profibrotic pathway activation. EV inhalation altered cardiovascular function, with decreased heart rate ( P < 0.01), and elevated blood pressure ( P = 0.016). These data demonstrate that chronic inhalation of EV may lead to increased inflammation, organ damage, and cardiorenal and hepatic disease.

BACKGROUND: We performed a meta-analysis to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) during a treatment cycle of at least 1 year. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were searched by using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Systematic review was carried out using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. The data was evaluated and statistically analyzed by using RevMan version 5.3.0. RESULTS: Five studies including 4348 patients were studied. The analysis found that the combination group was significantly greater effect in international prostate symptom score (mean difference [MD], - 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 2.20 to - 0.66; P = 0.0003), prostate volume (MD, - 10.13; 95% CI, - 12.38 to - 7.88; P < 0.00001), transitional zone volume (MD, - 3.18; 95% CI, - 3.57 to - 2.79; P<0.0001), maximum urine flow rate (MD, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.29; P < 0.00001), prostate specific antigen (MD, - 0.54; 95% CI, - 0.80 to - 0.29; P < 0.0001) and post-void residual volume (MD, - 3.85; 95% CI, - 4.95 to - 2.76; P < 0.00001) compared with the tamsulosin group. In terms of safety, including adverse events (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.17; P = 0.001), erectile dysfunction (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.73 to 2.92; P < 0.00001), ejaculation disorder (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.97 to 5.79; P < 0.0001), retrograde ejaculation (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.93; P = 0.03), decreased libido (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.53 to 3.31; P < 0.0001) and loss of libido (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.94 to 5.88; P<0.0001), the combination group showed poor tolerance than the tamsulosin group with the exception of dizziness (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.80; P = 0.50). The combination group significantly reduced the risk of clinical progression than the tamsulosin group especially in incidence of BPH-related symptom progression (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.67; P < 0.00001) and acute urinary retention (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.98; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride provides a preferable therapeutic effect for BPH with a higher incidence of sexual side effects, but combination-therapy can markedly reduce risk of BPH-related symptom progression and acute urinary retention relative to tamsulosin monotherapy.
30638089	Triolein	Embolism, Fat	1	0	0	0		Evidence for angiotensin mediation of the late histopathological effects of pulmonary fat embolism: Protection by losartan in a rat model.	PURPOSE: In a model of fat embolism using triolein-treated rats, we have reported that the acute pulmonary histopathological changes at 48 hrs were ameliorated by the angiotensin AT1 receptor blocker losartan, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren. Although much of the pathology had declined by 3 weeks, the changes persisted at 6 weeks. The purpose of the study was to extends the time course investigation to 10 weeks and to examines whether the fat embolism effects continue to be blocked by losartan when given at a late time period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unanesthetized rats were challenged with i.v. triolein or saline. After 6 weeks, one group received saline or losartan i.p. and the losartan group also received losartan in the drinking water. At 10 weeks, the experiment was terminated. RESULTS: Confirming previous results, the fat embolism group showed normal weight gain at 6 weeks without apparent distress and also appeared normal at 10 weeks. However, at 10 weeks the lungs showed inflammatory and fibrotic changes that were greater than those found at 6 weeks. These changes were reduced by losartan. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the effects of fat embolism continue to progress to 10 weeks after the initial insult with triolein. The fact that the protective effects of losartan treatment started at 6 weeks supports the involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in late as well as early stages of the histopathological changes following fat embolism. It also supports the use of angiotensin blockade in clinical situations even long after an initial trauma where fat embolism is suspected.
29550610	Acetaminophen	Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects	0	0	0	0		Pregnancy risk factors in relation to oppositional-defiant and conduct disorder symptoms in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.	BACKGROUND: Pregnancy factors have been implicated in offspring oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) symptoms. Literature still holds notable limitations, such as studying only a restricted set of pregnancy factors, use of screening questionnaires which assess broadly defined outcome measures, and lack of control for disruptive behavior comorbidity and genetic confounds. We aimed to address these gaps by prospectively studying a broad range of pregnancy factors in relation to both offspring ODD and CD symptomatology in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parent and Children. METHODS: Outcomes were ODD and CD symptom scores at age 7;9 years using the Development and Well-Being Assessment interview. We analyzed maternal (N  approximately  6300) and teacher ratings (N  approximately  4400) of ODD and CD scores separately using negative binomial regression in multivariable models. Control variables included comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, ODD or CD symptoms as appropriate, and genetic risk scores based on an independent CD genome-wide association study. RESULTS: Higher ODD symptom scores were linked to paracetamol use (IRR = 1.24 [98.3% confidence interval 1.05-1.47], P = 0.002, teacher ratings) and life events stress (IRR = 1.22 [1.07-1.39], P = 0.002, maternal ratings) during pregnancy. Higher CD symptom scores were linked to maternal smoking (IRR = 1.33 [1.18-1.51], P < 0.001, maternal ratings), life events stress (IRR = 1.24 [1.11-1.38], P < 0.001, maternal ratings) and depressive symptoms (IRR = 1.14 [1.01-1.30], P = 0.006, maternal ratings) during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Common and potentially preventable pregnancy risk factors were independently related to both offspring ODD and CD symptomatology in children from the general population. Future studies should further address genetic confounds and confounding by environmental factors later in life.

30830659	Tegafur	Neutropenia	0	0	0	0		Japanese subgroup analysis of a phase III study of S-1 versus docetaxel in non-small cell lung cancer patients after platinum-based treatment: EAST-LC.	INTRODUCTION: The East Asia S-1 Trial in Lung Cancer (EAST-LC) was a randomized phase III study conducted in East Asia that demonstrated the non-inferiority of S-1 to docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we reported the results of the Japanese subgroup treated with docetaxel 60 mg/m(2), the standard dosage in Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either S-1 or docetaxel. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), quality of life (QOL), and safety. RESULTS: Patient characteristics in the Japanese subgroup (n = 724) were similar to those in the overall EAST-LC population. Median OS was 13.4 months in the S-1 group and 12.6 months in the docetaxel group. In pemetrexed-pretreated patients, OS with S-1 was similar to that with docetaxel. Median PFS was 2.9 and 3.0 months in the S-1 and docetaxel groups, respectively. RR was 9.4% and 10.3% in the S-1 and docetaxel groups, respectively. The QOL of patients treated with S-1 was better compared with that of patients treated with docetaxel. Decreased appetite and diarrhea were more common in the S-1 group, whereas the frequency of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia was markedly higher in the docetaxel group. CONCLUSIONS: This Japanese subgroup analysis showed that S-1 had similar efficacy to docetaxel in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC. These results are similar to those of the overall EAST-LC population.

31074377	Sirolimus	Nervous System Diseases	0	0	0	0		ODAE: Ontology-based systematic representation and analysis of drug adverse events and its usage in study of adverse events given different patient age and disease conditions.	BACKGROUND: Drug adverse events (AEs), or called adverse drug events (ADEs), are ranked one of the leading causes of mortality. The Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) has been widely used for adverse event AE representation, standardization, and analysis. OAE-based ADE-specific ontologies, including ODNAE for drug-associated neuropathy-inducing AEs and OCVDAE for cardiovascular drug AEs, have also been developed and used. However, these ADE-specific ontologies do not consider the effects of other factors (e.g., age and drug-treated disease) on the outcomes of ADEs. With more ontological studies of ADEs, it is also critical to develop a general purpose ontology for representing ADEs for various types of drugs. RESULTS: Our survey of FDA drug package insert documents and other resources for 224 neuropathy-inducing drugs discovered that many drugs (e.g., sirolimus and linezolid) cause different AEs given patients' age or the diseases treated by the drugs. To logically represent the complex relations among drug, drug ingredient and mechanism of action, AE, age, disease, and other related factors, an ontology design pattern was developed and applied to generate a community-driven open-source Ontology of Drug Adverse Events (ODAE). The ODAE development follows the OBO Foundry ontology development principles (e.g., openness and collaboration). Built on a generalizable ODAE design pattern and extending the OAE and NDF-RT ontology, ODAE has represented various AEs associated with the over 200 neuropathy-inducing drugs given different age and disease conditions. ODAE is now deposited in the Ontobee for browsing and queries. As a demonstration of usage, a SPARQL query of the ODAE knowledge base was developed to identify all the drugs having the mechanisms of ion channel interactions, the diseases treated with the drugs, and AEs after the treatment in adult patients. AE-specific drug class effects were also explored using ODAE and SPARQL. CONCLUSION: ODAE provides a general representation of ADEs given different conditions and can be used for querying scientific questions. ODAE is also a robust knowledge base and platform for semantic and logic representation and study of ADEs of more drugs in the future.
30928983	Bevacizumab	Endophthalmitis	0	0	0	0		Same-Day Bilateral Intravitreal Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Injections: Experience of a Large Canadian Retina Center.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes and complications of bilateral same-day intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study that included 524 eyes of 262 patients who received concomitant bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in 2016 at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto. If any of the patients were receiving simultaneous bilateral injections on a regular basis prior to 2016, data pertaining to previous injections were also reviewed. Everyone received bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept in an office setting. RESULTS: A total of 9,798 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (4,899 bilateral injection sessions) were performed in 524 eyes of 262 patients. The average number of bilateral injection sessions per patient was 18.7 +/- 14.1. Ranibizumab was the most commonly used anti-VEGF drug (83.8%). The incidence of endophthalmitis was 0.01%, and there were 2 episodes of acute intraocular inflammation among the 9,798 injections (0.02%). All 3 cases occurred after treatment with ranibizumab. There were 2 deaths (0.76%) due to nonvascular causes but no vascular related systemic adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Same-day bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections present a low rate of complications and are well tolerated by patients. This safe practice may reduce the burden on the health-care system and on the patients.

BACKGROUND: Bullous disorders associated with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy are increasingly reported and may pose distinct therapeutic challenges. Their frequency and impact on cancer therapy are not well established. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and histopathologic findings, frequency, and impact on cancer therapy of bullous eruptions due to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients evaluated by the oncodermatology clinic and consultative service of Yale New Haven Hospital from 2016 to 2018. RESULTS: We identified 9 of 853 patients who developed bullous eruptions ( approximately 1%) that were treated with an-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy at our institution during the study period: 7 presented with bullous pemphigoid, 1 presented with bullous lichenoid dermatitis, and 1 presented with linear IgA bullous dermatosis in the context of vancomycin therapy. In all, 8 patients required systemic steroids, 5 required maintenance therapy, and 8 required interruption of immunotherapy. All 9 patients had an initial positive tumor response or stable disease, but 4 went on to develop disease progression. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study from a single tertiary care center. CONCLUSIONS: Bullous disorders developed in approximately 1% of patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy at our institution and frequently resulted in interruption of immune therapy and management with systemic corticosteroids and occasionally steroid-sparing agents.

PURPOSE: To report ocular side effects after inadvertent intracameral injection of a high dose of cefuroxime. METHODS: Nineteen eyes of 19 patients were seen in our eye department 1 week after the referring surgeon had injected an erroneous dose of intracameral cefuroxime (12.5 mg/0.1 mL in 14 patients, Group A, and 10 mg/0.1 mL in 5 patients, Group B) at the end of a cataract surgery. A complete ophthalmic examination was performed postoperatively. RESULTS: Eight patients (42.10%) exhibited ocular side effects. One patient (Group A) developed a noninfectious panuveitis. One case (Group B) had a serous macular detachment. Five patients (4 from Group A and 1 from Group B) showed a disruption of the ellipsoid layer with temporary/permanent drop in visual acuity. One patient presented with color alteration (Group A), but electrodiagnostic studies did not reveal any significant alterations. CONCLUSION: Anterior and posterior inflammation has been described after intracameral injection of high dose of cefuroxime. In this study, 10 mg to 12.5 mg of intracameral cefuroxime is shown to be, principally, toxic to the retina with transient or permanent retinal changes on optical coherence tomography which correlate with visual outcomes postoperatively. Protocols to avoid dilution errors should be available in theaters during cataract surgery where such commercial preparations are not available.

29415534	Ribavirin	Thyroid Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Long-term outcomes of thyroid dysfunction in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin.	INTRODUCTION: Thyroid dysfunctions (TDs) are associated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PegIFN-alpha/RBV) therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and are considered as possible extrahepatic manifestation of HCV infection OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the long-term outcomes of TDs in patients with CHC treated with PegIFN-alpha/RBV METHODS: A total of 1,047 treatment-naive patients with CHC were treated with PegIFN-alpha/RBV. TSH and FT4 were assessed at baseline, every 3 months during therapy and 6, 12 and 24 months after the end of therapy. Analysis was performed for two groups of patients depending on the absence (group A, n=77) or presence (group B, n=39) of TDs at baseline RESULTS: At baseline, TDs' prevalence was 3.7%; 53.8% hypothyroidism, 38.5% goiters, and 7.7% hyperthyroidism. 77 (7.4%) out of 1,008 euthyroid patients developed TDs; 45.5% hypothyroidism, 33.8% hyperthyroidism, 19.5% destructive thyroiditis, and 1.3% goiters. TDs' remission (TDR) was achieved in 59/116 (50.9%) of treated patients; 64.9% in group A and 23.1% in group B (p<0.001). Hyperthyroidism as compared to hypothyroidism increases the odds of TDR (OR=4.87 (1.65-14.35), p=0.004), whereas preexisting TDs and higher baseline viral load tend to decrease the probability of TDR (OR=0.21 (0.07-0.58), p=0.003 and OR=0.4 (0.22-0.73), p=0.003, respectively) CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TDs was low but over one-third of patients in whom TDs developed under PegIFN-alpha/RBV therapy did not recover. In one-fourth of patients with preexisting TDs remissions were observed. Treatment with PegIFN-alpha in the past must be taken into account as a potential cause of TDs
30003323	Cyclosporine	Kidney Neoplasms	0	1	0	0		Renal cell cancer after kidney transplantation.	PURPOSE: This study aims to identify modifiable risk factors for de novo renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after kidney transplantation in a matched-pair approach matching for unmodifiable factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand six hundred fifty-five adults who underwent kidney transplantation in the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2012 were analyzed. Patients with RCC after kidney transplantation were matched in a 1:2 ratio with those without RCC using the indication for transplantation, age at transplantation (+/- 10 years), recipient sex (male/female), number of received transplants, living organ donor transplantation (yes/no), and time of follow-up in days as matching criteria. The paired t test was used to compare continuous variables and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for categorical variables. Multivariable conditional logistic regression modeling was used to identify independent risk factors for RCC. RESULTS: In matched-pair analysis, a total number of 26 incident cases with RCC after kidney transplantation could be matched. Post-transplant RCC was significantly associated with longer durations of pre-transplant hemodialysis (p = 0.007) and post-transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine (p = 0.029) and/or mycophenolate mofetil (p = 0.020) and with larger proportions of post-transplant time on mycophenolate mofetil (p = 0.046) and/or prednisolone medication (p = 0.042). Multivariable conditional logistic regression modeling revealed a significant risk increasing multiplicative factor interaction between the duration of pre-transplant dialysis (years) and the time of prednisolone usage (percent/100). Cyclosporine A usage and mycophenolate mofetil usage were also revealed as independent, significant risk factors for RCC development. CONCLUSIONS: Longer pre-transplant dialysis, cyclosporine-based protocols and/or intensified immunosuppression with additional mycophenolate mofetil, and larger proportions of time of prednisolone treatment during follow-up increase de novo RCC risk.

30103684	Sirolimus	Diarrhea	1	0	0	0		Safety and efficacy of Rapamune(R) (Sirolimus) in kidney transplant recipients: results of a prospective post-marketing surveillance study in Korea.	BACKGROUND: Few post-marketing surveillance studies have examined the safety and efficacy of Rapamune(R) (Sirolimus) in Asian countries. This study aimed to better understand safety and efficacy of Rapamune for kidney transplant recipients in the routine clinical practice setting in Korea. METHODS: This was an open-label, non-comparative, observational, prospective, multi-center, post-marketing surveillance study conducted at 15 Korean transplant centers between 31 August 2009 and 24 September 2015. The subjects were administered Rapamune as part of routine practice. The safety was monitored based on reporting of adverse events (AEs). Efficacy endpoints included acute rejection, graft function, graft survival, and patient survival. RESULTS: Rapamune was most commonly used for late conversion therapy after post-transplant 1 year and was substituted for anti-metabolites (63.6%) or calcineurin inhibitors (28.7%). The median treatment duration of Rapamune was 182 days. Among 209 subjects enrolled, AEs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 54.07% and 43.06% of subjects, respectively, in the safety analysis set. Most of the AEs were expected (96.21%), mild (75.83%), did not result in any action taken with regard to the study drug (72.99%), and resolved by the end of the study (75.36%). The most frequently reported AEs/ADRs were pharyngitis and diarrhea. Most of the serious AEs/ADRs occurred in one or two subjects. Unexpected ADRs of renal artery occlusion and cholangitis were reported by one subject each. The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was 2.87%. At the end of the study, 99.51% of the subjects and their grafts had survived. The mean eGFR was 64.72 +/- 19.56 mL/min. CONCLUSIONS: Rapamune had an acceptable safety profile in prevention of kidney allograft rejection in Korea.

31045772	Morphine	Myoclonus	1	1	0	0	0.0	Intrathecal morphine combined with ropivacaine induces spinal myoclonus in cancer patients with an implanted intrathecal drug delivery system: Three case reports.	RATIONALE: Although intrathecal opioid infusion has been used for decades for the treatment of severe pain, myoclonus as one of the complications of this therapeutic modality is now beginning to be recognized more. PATIENTS CONCERNS: Here, we report three patients who developed myoclonus after dose adjustment in intrathecal drug delivery system for the treatment of refractory cancer pain. DIAGNOSIS: Spinal myoclonus is a sudden, brief, shock-like muscle contractions originating from the central nervous system. In our cases, it occurred after opioid administration via intrathecal delivery system with no abnormality found in laboratory or imaging examinations. INTERVENTIONS: Spinal myoclonus can be treated effectively by reducing the dose or infusion rate as described in case 1, or changing from an intrathecal to systemic administration in case 2, or correcting infusion and bolus parameters mistakes in case 3. OUTCOMES: All patients recovered quickly after stopping or decreasing the intrathecal drug infusion. LESSONS: Prevention is more important than treatment as for spinal myoclonus. Pain management teams should be aware of this distressing complication. Dose of intrathecal drugs should not exceed the recommended maximal daily doses by guidelines and patient education is important for successful intrathecal analgesic therapy.
31033491	Methamphetamine	Ischemia	1	1	0	1	1.0	Acute Methamphetamine-Induced Hepatic and Pancreatic Ischemia.	Methamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant that induces arousal, a positive mood, cardiac stimulation, and an acute improvement in cognitive domains. Its illicit exploitation is rapidly growing in North America. Typically, extended use of the drug induces organ damage via vasoconstriction and subsequent ischemia. This case specifically discusses hepatic and pancreatic pathology resulting from methamphetamine overdose alongside an unusual discovery of globally necrotic von Meyenburg complexes.

Denosumab, a novel agent that inhibits osteoclasts, reduces the risk of fracture in patients with osteoporosis. However, worsening of hypophosphatemia and other symptoms may be induced by denosumab in patients with pre-existing hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. A 58-year-old man with hepatitis B presented with diffuse bone pain and muscle weakness. Denosumab was prescribed by the orthopedist according to documented low bone mass and spine compression fracture. After administering denosumab, the patient's bone pain worsened, and he later developed a right tibia stress fracture. His condition was diagnosed as adult-onset hypophosphatemic osteomalacia complicated by multiple bone fractures, which resulted from Fanconi syndrome with proximal tubulopathy due to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) treatment for his hepatitis B. Denosumab use leads to aggressive hypophosphatemic osteomalacia and the complication of stress fractures, because of its effects on bone resorption. Physicians should be aware that in patients with chronic hepatitis B monoinfection who are administered TDF therapy, bone pain or fracture is possible but preventable by timely monitoring of serum phosphate levels. Denosumab should not be used in patients with untreated osteomalacia or vitamin D deficiency, as it may lead not only to hypocalcemia but also to hypophosphatemia in these patients.

30929065	Amiodarone	Bradycardia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Cardiovascular Collapse with Intravenous Amiodarone in Children: A Multi-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of cardiovascular collapse in children receiving intravenous (IV) amiodarone and to identify the population at risk. DESIGN: A multicenter study of patients </= 18 years of age who received intravenous amiodarone between January 2005 and December 2015. A retrospective analysis was performed to identify patients who developed cardiovascular collapse (bradycardia and/or hypotension). RESULTS: Of 456 patients who received amiodarone, cardiovascular collapse occurred in 47 patients (10%). Patient risk factors for collapse in a univariate analysis were as follows: age < 3 months (p = 0.04), depressed cardiac function (p < 0.001), blood pressure below 3rd percentile (p < 0.001), high lactate at baseline (p < 0.001). Administration risk factors included bolus administration (p = 0.04), and bolus administration over </= 20 min (p = 0.04). In multivariate analysis, age, baseline blood pressure less than 3rd percentile, and rapid bolus delivery were independent risk factors for cardiovascular collapse in the study group. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the collapse group (28% versus 8%). CONCLUSION: We found an association between IV amiodarone administration and the risk of developing cardiovascular collapse in a significant subset of children. Extreme caution and careful hemodynamic monitoring is recommended when using IV amiodarone in this population, especially in young infants, hemodynamically compromised patients, and in patients receiving rapid amiodarone bolus administration.

30628012	Vitamin D	Atherosclerosis	1	0	0	0		Calcium and vitamin D supplement intake may increase arterial stiffness in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.	OBJECTIVES: Low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) have been associated with a higher frequency of risk factors and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of 25(OH)D, cardiovascular risk factors, and subclinical atherosclerosis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. METHOD: Forty-seven female SLE patients were studied. Data collected included demographics, SLE activity, disease damage, cardiovascular risk factors, and markers of subclinical atherosclerosis. Patient treatments and vitamin D and calcium supplementation (VitD-Ca) were recorded. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/l measured by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. Atherosclerosis was assessed by measuring the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) by Doppler velocimetry and intima-media thickness (IMT) by B-mode ultrasound scanning. RESULTS: 61.7% of patients were vitamin D deficient with a mean level of 31.91 +/- 10.21 nmol/l. Serum vitamin D concentration was significantly higher in the 23 patients taking VitD-Ca supplements than that in patients not supplemented (p = 0.004). No significant association was found between 25(OH)D serum levels and cardiovascular risk factors, disease activity, or different treatments for SLE. A significant positive correlation was found between 25(OH)D levels, PWV (p = 0.02), and IMT (p = 0.01); moreover, patients taking VitD-Ca supplements presented an increased arterial stiffness. CONCLUSION: Patients with arterial stiffness showed higher levels of serum vitamin D and most of them were on VitD-Ca supplements. Although prospective studies with a larger number of patients and follow-up are needed, our findings suggest that VitD-Ca supplementation may have effects on SLE patients' arterial stiffness.

The association of the high blood pressure D variant of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene with medication-related jaw osteonecrosis (MRONJ) is described in two Greek patients. The first patient, a 73-year-old man, took zolendronate, 4 mg/100 ml IV once per month for two years for prostate cancer and bone metastases. Three months after drug discontinuation, extraction of the first premolar was performed. After the intervention, he suffered from osteonecrosis of the mandible. He presented with hypertension and genetic testing revealed that he was homozygous for the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene. The second patient, a 65 years old woman, took denosumab, 120 mg subcutaneously once per month for 6 months for possible bone metastases from breast cancer. Three months after extraction of the first molar, she suffered from MRONJ. He also presented with hypertension and genetic testing revealed that she had the high blood pressure D variant of the ACE gene in a heterozygous state, which moderately predisposes to hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that genetic predisposition to hypertension may increase risk for MRONJ.

30404783	Alemtuzumab	Autoimmune Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Vitiligo after alemtuzumab treatment: Secondary autoimmunity is not all about B cells.	OBJECTIVE: To report 3 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) showing vitiligo after treatment with alemtuzumab. METHODS: Retrospective case series including flow cytometric analyses and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: We describe 3 cases of alemtuzumab-treated patients with RRMS developing vitiligo 52, 18, and 14 months after alemtuzumab initiation. Histopathology shows loss of epidermal pigmentation with absence of melanocytes and interface dermatitis with CD8(+) T-cell infiltration. Also compatible with pathophysiologic concepts of vitiligo, peripheral blood mononuclear cells of one patient showed high proportions of CD8(+) T cells with an activated (human leukocyte antigen-DR(+)), memory (CD45RO(+)), and type 1 cytokine (interferon-gamma + tumor necrosis factor-alpha) phenotype at vitiligo onset compared to a control cohort of alemtuzumab-treated patients with RRMS (n = 30). Of note, analysis of CD8 TCR repertoire in this patient revealed a highly increased clonality and reduced repertoire diversity compared to healthy controls and treatment-naive patients with RRMS. We observed a predominance of single clones at baseline in this patient and alemtuzumab treatment did not substantially affect the proportions of most abundant clones over time. CONCLUSION: The 3 cases represent a detailed description of vitiligo as a T-cell-mediated secondary autoimmune disease following alemtuzumab treatment. The prevailing concept of unleashed B-cell responses might therefore not cover all facets of alemtuzumab-related secondary autoimmunity. Mechanistic studies, especially on TCR repertoire, might help clarify the underlying mechanisms.
29178032	Lithium Chloride	Polyuria	0	0	0	0		Lithium increases ammonium excretion leading to altered urinary acid-base buffer composition.	Previous reports identify a voltage dependent distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) secondary to lithium (Li(+)) salt administration. This was based on the inability of Li(+)-treated patients to increase the urine-blood (U-B) pCO(2) when challenged with NaHCO(3) and, the ability of sodium neutral phosphate or Na(2)SO(4) administration to restore U-B pCO(2) in experimental animal models. The underlying mechanisms for the Li(+)-induced dRTA are still unknown. To address this point, a 7 days time course of the urinary acid-base parameters was investigated in rats challenged with LiCl, LiCitrate, NaCl, or NaCitrate. LiCl induced the largest polyuria and a mild metabolic acidosis. Li(+)-treatment induced a biphasic response. In the first 2 days, proper urine volume and acidification occurred, while from the 3rd day of treatment, polyuria developed progressively. In this latter phase, the LiCl-treated group progressively excreted more NH(4)(+) and less pCO(2), suggesting that NH(3)/NH(4)(+) became the main urinary buffer. This physiological parameter was corroborated by the upregulation of NBCn1 (a marker of increased ammonium recycling) in the inner stripe of outer medulla of LiCl treated rats. Finally, by investigating NH(4)(+) excretion in ENaC-cKO mice, a model resistant to Li(+)-induced polyuria, a primary role of the CD was confirmed. By definition, dRTA is characterized by deficient urinary ammonium excretion. Our data question the presence of a voltage-dependent Li(+)-induced dRTA in rats treated with LiCl for 7 days and the data suggest that the alkaline urine pH induced by NH(3)/NH(4)(+) as the main buffer has lead to the interpretation dRTA in previous studies.

29778097	Pimozide	Hyperprolactinemia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics increase breast cancer risk by activating JAK-STAT5 in precancerous lesions.	BACKGROUND: Psychiatric medications are widely prescribed in the USA. Many antipsychotics cause serum hyperprolactinemia as an adverse side effect; prolactin-Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling both induces cell differentiation and suppresses apoptosis. It is controversial whether these antipsychotics increase breast cancer risk. METHODS: We investigated the impact of several antipsychotics on mammary tumorigenesis initiated by retrovirus-mediated delivery of either ErbB2 or HRas or by transgenic expression of Wnt-1. RESULTS: We found that the two hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics, risperidone and pimozide, prompted precancerous lesions to progress to cancer while aripiprazole, which did not cause hyperprolactinemia, did not. We observed that risperidone and pimozide (but not aripiprazole) caused precancerous cells to activate STAT5 and suppress apoptosis while exerting no impact on proliferation. Importantly, we demonstrated that these effects of antipsychotics on early lesions required the STAT5 gene function. Furthermore, we showed that only two-week treatment of mice with ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, blocked STAT5 activation, restored apoptosis, and prevented early lesion progression. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics instigate precancerous cells to progress to cancer via JAK/STAT5 to suppress the apoptosis anticancer barrier, and these cancer-promoting effects can be prevented by prophylactic anti-JAK/STAT5 treatment. This preclinical work exposes a potential breast cancer risk from hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics in certain patients and suggests a chemoprevention regime that is relatively easy to implement compared to the standard 5-year anti-estrogenic treatment in women who have or likely have already developed precancerous lesions while also requiring hyperprolactinemia-inducing antipsychotics.

31008947	Cyclosporine	Muscular Diseases	1	1	0	0	1.0	A case report of cyclosporine-induced myopathy with subacute muscular atrophy as initial presentation.	RATIONALE: Cyclosporine A (CsA) is a potent immunosuppressive agent originally used to prevent rejection after organ transplantation but now more frequently used for treatment of refractory autoimmune diseases. It can induce adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal reactions, and gingival hyperplasia whist myopathy with subacute muscular atrophy are rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 55-year-old male patient with idiopathic membranous nephropathy treated with cyclosporine A at 3 mg/kg/d and prednisone at 0.5 mg/kg.d for more than 20 days, gradually developed lower limb weakness, which were progressively aggravated until he was unable to stand or walk. A physical examination show muscle atrophy of both lower extremities, which was more severe in the right thigh muscle than the left, decreased muscular tension of the limbs was also observed. DIAGNOSES: Light microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy of muscle (quadriceps femoris) biopsy revealed drug-induced myopathy rather than neurogenic damage. INTERVENTIONS: Cyclosporine was withdrawn and replaced with cyclophosphamide tablets, prednisone remain unchanged and other symptomatic therapies were also administered. OUTCOMES: His bilateral thigh muscle atrophy showed improvement and lower limb weakness was obviously alleviated and he could stand and walk with the help of others 4 weeks later. Gradually, his thigh muscle atrophy was alleviated so that he was able to walk independently. After follow-up, no similar symptoms were found in the patients. LESSONS: CsA-induced myopathy with muscular atrophy is rare and serious, which can be identified according to pathological characteristics.
30431425	Ticlopidine	Ischemia	0	0	0	0		The association between clopidogrel and 2-oxo-clopidogrel plasma levels and the long-term clinical outcome after acute myocardial infarction .	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A significant number of ischemic events occur after acute myocardial infarction (MI), even when adhering to dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin and clopidogrel. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the concentration of the prodrug clopidogrel and its intermediary metabolite 2-oxo-clopidogrel plasma as well as demographic and clinical factors, and the long-term clinical outcome in patients with their first acute MI, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction NSTEMI, treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 172 consecutive patients with their first acute MI, 88 STEMI, and 84 NSTEMI, treated with PCI. On the third day of hospitalization, blood samples were collected from each patient to measure the concentration of clopidogrel and its metabolite 2-oxo-clopidogrel using the UHPLC-DAD-MS method. The following clinical outcomes were registered during the 28-month follow-up: mortality from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for urgent myocardial revascularization or heart failure. RESULTS: Lower dose-adjusted clopidogrel concentrations (p < 0.05) were measured in NSTEMI patients with a composite of the hard clinical endpoint events of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal MI, or a nonfatal stroke. During the follow-up, there was a 3.4 times higher risk of hard clinical endpoint events (p < 0.05) for each unit decrement of the dose-adjusted clopidogrel plasma concentration. Lower dose-adjusted concentrations of clopidogrel in these patients were associated with lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and fentanyl (p < 0.001) and pantoprazole administration (p < 0.01) during the acute phase of MI. CONCLUSION: In patients with acute MI treated with PCI, lower dose-adjusted clopidogrel and dose-adjusted 2-oxo-clopidogrel plasma concentrations were associated with an increased risk of ischemic events. .

30574797	Aprepitant	Nausea	0	0	0	0		HTX-019 via 2-min injection or 30-min infusion in healthy subjects.	AIM: HTX-019 (CINVANTI((R)) [aprepitant injectable emulsion]) is a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist approved for preventing acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). HTX-019 is free of polysorbate 80 and other synthetic surfactants and showed bioequivalence to and a more favorable safety profile than fosaprepitant when administered as a 30-min infusion in healthy subjects. The shortage of small-volume parenteral solutions led to a recommendation to administer HTX-019 by intravenous push. The objectives were to evaluate pharmacokinetics, tolerability and safety following HTX-019 administration by injection versus infusion. MATERIALS & METHODS: Study comprised Part A, a pilot Phase I, single-center, randomized, pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability, open-label study, followed by Part B, a two-sequence crossover study of HTX-019 130 mg in healthy adults, via injection and infusion. Blood samples were evaluated for aprepitant pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence. Safety evaluations included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, clinical laboratory testing and electrocardiograms. RESULTS: In Part A, 24 subjects were randomly assigned to three cohorts (n = 8 per cohort) and received HTX-019 130 mg, administered intravenously over 15 min (cohort 1), 5 min (cohort 2) or 2 min (cohort 3). Progression to Part B occurred after acceptable tolerability was established in cohorts 2 and 3. In Part B, 50 randomized subjects received a 2-min injection (9 ml/min) and 30-min infusion (296 ml/h) of HTX-019 130 mg. Bioequivalence was demonstrated for HTX-019 injection and infusion. Both administration methods via a peripheral line were well tolerated; eight subjects experienced 11 TEAEs (six related) following injection and nine experienced 14 TEAEs (nine related) following infusion. Headache and fatigue were the most prevalent treatment-related TEAEs; one subject per group experienced feeling hot </=30 min after drug administration. CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles of 2-min HTX-019 injection support this potential alternative administration method for CINV prevention.

IMPORTANCE: Oral mucositis causes substantial morbidity during head and neck radiotherapy. In a randomized study, doxepin mouthwash was shown to reduce oral mucositis-related pain. A common mouthwash comprising diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid is also widely used. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash for the treatment of oral mucositis-related pain. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 3 randomized trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, to May 16, 2016, at 30 US institutions and included 275 patients who underwent definitive head and neck radiotherapy, had an oral mucositis pain score of 4 points or greater (scale, 0-10), and were followed up for a maximum of 28 days. INTERVENTIONS: Ninety-two patients were randomized to doxepin mouthwash (25 mg/5 mL water); 91 patients to diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid; and 92 patients to placebo. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary end point was total oral mucositis pain reduction (defined by the area under the curve and adjusted for baseline pain score) during the 4 hours after a single dose of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash compared with a single dose of placebo. The minimal clinically important difference was a 3.5-point change. The secondary end points included drowsiness, unpleasant taste, and stinging or burning. All scales ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). RESULTS: Among the 275 patients randomized (median age, 61 years; 58 [21%] women), 227 (83%) completed treatment per protocol. Mucositis pain during the first 4 hours decreased by 11.6 points in the doxepin mouthwash group, by 11.7 points in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group, and by 8.7 points in the placebo group. The between-group difference was 2.9 points (95% CI, 0.2-6.0; P = .02) for doxepin mouthwash vs placebo and 3.0 points (95% CI, 0.1-5.9; P = .004) for diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo. More drowsiness was reported with doxepin mouthwash vs placebo (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-4.0]; P = .03), unpleasant taste (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-3.0]; P = .002), and stinging or burning (by 4.0 points [95% CI, 2.5-5.0]; P < .001). Maximum grade 3 adverse events for the doxepin mouthwash occurred in 3 patients (4%); diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash, 3 (4%); and placebo, 2 (2%). Fatigue was reported by 5 patients (6%) in the doxepin mouthwash group and no patients in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, the use of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo significantly reduced oral mucositis pain during the first 4 hours after administration; however, the effect size was less than the minimal clinically important difference. Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety for both mouthwashes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02229539.

29540567	Styrene	Occupational Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Sinonasal adenocarcinoma following styrene exposure in the reinforced plastics industry.	BACKGROUND: Sinonasal adenocarcinoma is a rare disease expected to have rare causes and potential for strong risk factors as reflected by the strong association with occupational wood dust exposure. High level styrene exposure is a rare and suspected carcinogen, and this study examines the exposure-response relation between occupational styrene exposure, sinonasal adenocarcinoma and other subtypes. METHODS: We followed 73 092 styrene-exposed workers from 1968 to 2011 and identified sinonasal cancers in the Danish Cancer Registry. We modelled cumulative styrene exposure and estimated incidence rates and age, sex and wood-industry adjusted ORs. RESULTS: During 1 585 772 person-years, we observed nine cases of adenocarcinoma, corresponding to a fivefold non-significantly increased OR for estimates of high versus low cumulative styrene exposure (OR 5.11, 95% CI 0.58 to 45.12). The increased risk was confined to exposure received during the recent 15 years. The other histological subtypes showed no increased risk. CONCLUSION: This study suggests increased risk of sinonasal adenocarcinoma following styrene exposure. The observations are, however, few, confounding from wood dust exposure cannot be ruled out, and additional studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
30267637	Fentanyl	Hyperalgesia	1	1	0	1	1.0	Opioid Induced Hyperalgesia with Intrathecal Infusion of High-Dose Fentanyl.	INTRODUCTION: Despite being reported since 1943 as well as being the subject of a large body of literature since that time, no consensus has been reached regarding the etiology of opioid induced hyperalgesia (OIH). It is often described as a paradoxical increased pain response to noxious stimuli due to increased sensitization or an acute tolerance to opioids. CASE: We report the case of a 60 year old patient on chronic Intrathecal combined fentanyl and Bupivacaine who had worsening pain with increasing doses and improved after weaning off intrathecal opioids. CONCLUSION: OIH has been described in various settings including patients on methadone maintenance therapy, perioperative opioid administration, cancer patients on opioids, and healthy volunteers who are acutely exposed to opioids, including high dose intrathecal opioids such as Morphine and Sufentanil. To our knowledge, no cases of opioid induced hyperalgesia was previously reported in the case of intrathecal Fentanyl.
30767356	Phenytoin	Spasm	0	0	0	0		Comparison of pentobarbital-phenytoin alone vs propofol prior to pentobarbital-phenytoin for euthanasia in 436 client-owned dogs.	OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence of adverse events during euthanasia of client-owned dogs administered either intravenous pentobarbital/phenytoin (PP) or PP after propofol delivery. DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective, observational, multi-site study. ANIMALS: Four hundred thirty-six dogs undergoing client-elected euthanasia over a 1-year period. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included placement of an IV catheter and delivery of euthanasia agents (PP for the PP group, propofol followed by PP for the propofol group). Seven pre-determined adverse events were recorded: agonal breaths, urination, defecation, vocalization, muscle activity, dysphoria, and catheter complications. Euthanasia scores for each patient were defined as the sum of all adverse events (0-7) the patient exhibited. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-six dogs were in the PP group and 200 dogs were in the propofol group. No significant differences were detected in the dose of PP administered (166.9 +/- 105.6 mg/kg for PP group, 182.6 +/- 109.8 mg/kg for propofol group). Propofol dogs received 4.5 +/- 2.9 mg/kg propofol. The incidence of >/= 1 adverse event was 35.2% in the PP group and 26.5% in the propofol group (P = 0.052). Mean euthanasia scores (0.47 PP group, 0.32 propofol group) were not significantly different (P = 0.08). Propofol significantly reduced the incidence of muscle activity (6% vs. 14%, odds ratio 0.39; P = 0.0079). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the likelihood of the studied adverse events during client-elected euthanasia in dogs when propofol was used prior to PP. There was a significant reduction in perimortem muscle activity if propofol was given prior to PP.

29851905	Warfarin	Intracranial Hemorrhage, Traumatic	1	1	0	0	0.0	The novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have worse outcomes compared with warfarin in patients with intracranial hemorrhage after TBI.	INTRODUCTION: Novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) use is increasing in trauma patients. The reversal of these agents after hemorrhage is still evolving. The aim of our study was to evaluate outcomes after traumatic brain injury in patients on NOACs. METHODS: 3-year (2014-2016) analysis of our prospectively maintained traumatic brain injury (TBI) database. We included all TBI patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on anticoagulants. Patients were stratified into two groups, those on NOACs and on warfarin, and were matched in a 1:2 ratio using propensity score matching for demographics, injury and vital parameters, type, and size of ICH. Outcome measures were progression of ICH, mortality, skilled nursing facility (SNF) disposition, and hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: We analyzed 1,459 TBI patients, of which 210 patients were matched (NAOCs, 70; warfarin, 140). Matched groups were similar in age (p = 0.21), mechanism of injury (p = 0.61), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (p = 0.54), Injury Severity Score (p = 0.62), and type and size of ICH (p = 0.09). Patients on preinjury NOACs had higher rate of progression (p = 0.03), neurosurgical intervention (p = 0.04), mortality (p = 0.04), and longer ICU LOS (p = 0.04) compared with patients on warfarin. However, there was no difference in hospital LOS (p = 0.22) and SNF disposition (p = 0.14). On sub-analysis of severe TBI patients (GCS </= 8), rate of progression (p = 0.59), neurosurgical intervention (p = 0.62), or mortality (p = 0.81) was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of NOACs generally carries a high risk of bleeding and can be detrimental in head injuries with ICH. NOAC use is associated with increased risk of progression of ICH, neurosurgical intervention, and mortality after a mild and moderate TBI. Primary care physicians and cardiologists need to reconsider the data on the need for anticoagulation and the type of agent used and weigh it against the risk of bleeding. In addition, development of reversal agents for the NOACs and implementation of a strict protocol for the reversal of these agents may lead to improved outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic studies, level III.
31314188	Guanine	Kidney Diseases	1	0	0	0		Effects of entecavir, tenofovir and telbivudine treatment on renal functions in chronic hepatitis B patients.	BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The aim of this study was to enlighten the controversy about the renal safety of entecavir, tenofovir, and telbivudine treatments in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients by comparing these treatments in real-world conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 104 treatment-naive patients with CHB monoinfection into our study. Patients were treated with entecavir monotherapy (n=38), tenofovir monotherapy (n=35), or telbivudine monotherapy (n=31). We then compared and statistically analyzed the effects of these drugs on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over a 24-month follow-up period. RESULTS: In the entecavir group, time-dependent change in eGFR was not statistically significant (p = 0.357). There was a statistically significant increase in eGFR in the telbivudine group at 12 months (p<0.001) and at 24 months (p<0.001) and, in contrast, a statistically significant decrease in the tenofovir group at 12 months (p<0.001) and at 24 months (p<0.001). There was no significant relationship between entecavir and eGFR change (p = 0.763). We found that tenofovir and telbivudine were independent predictors of eGFR change (decrease in eGFR, p<0.001 and increase in eGFR, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We recommend close follow-up of renal functions, especially for patients treated with tenofovir. Telbivudine was superior to the other drugs in terms of renal function. We conclude that an individualized therapy program considering treatment efficacy and side effects is the best option for patients.

29907236	Povidone-Iodine	Acidosis	0	0	0	0		Peritoneal lavage with povidone-iodine solution in colorectal cancer-induced rats.	BACKGROUND: Although peritoneal lavage with povidone-iodine (PVPI) is frequently performed after surgery on the gastrointestinal tract, the effects of PVPI on the intestinal epithelial barrier are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of abdominal irrigation with PVPI on the intestinal epithelial barrier in a colorectal cancer (CRC)-induced rat model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CRC model was induced in rats with azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate. Next, a total of 24 male CRC-induced rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8): (1) a sham-operated group, (2) an NS group (peritoneal lavage 0.9% NaCl), and (3) a PVPI group (peritoneal lavage with 0.45%-0.55% PVPI). The mean arterial pressure was continuously monitored throughout the experiment. The levels of plasma endotoxin and D-lactate, blood gases, and protein concentration were measured. The ultrastructural changes of the epithelial tight junctions were observed by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: The mean arterial pressure after peritoneal lavage was lower in the PVPI group than that in the NS group. The protein concentration and levels of endotoxin and D-lactate were higher in the PVPI group than they were in the PVPI group. In addition, PVPI treatment resulted in a markedly severe metabolic acidosis and intestinal mucosal injury compared with NS rats. CONCLUSIONS: Peritoneal lavage with PVPI dramatically compromises the integrity of the intestinal mucosa barrier and causes endotoxin shock in CRC rats. It is unsafe for clinical applications to include peritoneal lavage with PVPI in colorectal operations.
30236980	Flecainide	Tachycardia, Ventricular	1	0	0	0		Ventricular arrhythmia and death among atrial fibrillation patients using anti-arrhythmic drugs.	AIM: The aim of the study was to assess and compare the safety of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in an unselected real-world population of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a study of all patients with diagnosed AF in the Swedish Patient register who filled a prescription for sotalol, amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide or disopyramide during 2010 to 2015. The main end point consisted of arrhythmic death, successful resuscitation, new diagnosis of sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or implantation of ICD. All-cause mortality was a secondary end point. Minimum follow up was 1 year. Falsification end points were used to assess hidden confounding. 44,995 AF patients on AAD and 267,518 AF patients without AAD were studied during a total time at risk of over 1.1 million years. Compared to sotalol, the risk for the main end point was decreased with dronedarone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.90), similar with flecainide (HR 0.95, 0.69-1.32) and disopyramide (HR 1.30, CI 0.83-2.05). All-cause mortality was lower with dronedarone (HR 0.44, CI 0.34-0.57) and flecainide (HR 0.55, CI 0.44-0.68) than with sotalol. Hidden confounding prevented reliable assessment of amiodarone. CONCLUSIONS: Dronedarone was the only anti-arrhythmic drug with significantly lower risk for arrhythmic death, sustained ventricular arrhythmia or ICD implantation than sotalol among patients with atrial fibrillation. Both dronedarone and flecainide were associated with lower all-cause mortality than sotalol.

Compared to sotalol, the risk for the main end point was decreased with dronedarone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.90), similar with flecainide (HR 0.95, 0.69-1.32) and disopyramide (HR 1.30, CI 0.83-2.05). All-cause mortality was lower with dronedarone (HR 0.44, CI 0.34-0.57) and flecainide (HR 0.55, CI 0.44-0.68) than with sotalol. Hidden confounding prevented reliable assessment of amiodarone. CONCLUSIONS: Dronedarone was the only anti-arrhythmic drug with significantly lower risk for arrhythmic death, sustained ventricular arrhythmia or ICD implantation than sotalol among patients with atrial fibrillation. Both dronedarone and flecainide were associated with lower all-cause mortality than sotalol.
30110018	Trastuzumab	Oligohydramnios	1	1	0	0	1.0	Use of pertuzumab and trastuzumab during pregnancy.	Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies used for the treatment of breast cancer. Until now, there have been no reports on the use of pertuzumab during pregnancy and on its potential effects on the fetus. Herein, we present a breast cancer patient who received trastuzumab and pertuzumab treatment during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. This 22-year-old patient initially diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast was found to be negative for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor in the immunohistochemical examination. At the time of diagnosis, she had metastatic lesions and a protocol of docetaxel, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, q21, and zolendronic acid 4 mg every month was started. Following six courses of therapy, she had near-complete response, and, after administration of the same course of treatment for two additional cycles, treatment with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab was continued. While she was being followed-up with remission, a 20-week pregnancy was detected. A fetal ultrasound examination showed oligohydramnios and right renal agenesis. Treatment was stopped, and the fetus was monitored. After 7 weeks of follow-up, fetal growth retardation and anhydramnios were detected. The pregnancy was terminated. Fetal autopsy showed no urinary system pathology, but macroscopic and microscopic hyperplasia of the right adrenal gland was identified. Concomitant use of pertuzumab and trastuzumab during pregnancy may be associated with an unresolved oligohydramnios and/or anhydramnios risk. Extreme caution should be used when these monoclonal antibodies are administered during pregnancy.

29196616	Estradiol	Cell Transformation, Neoplastic	1	1	0	0	0.0	17beta-Estradiol sensitizes ovarian surface epithelium to transformation by suppressing Disabled-2 expression.	Estrogen replacement therapy increases the risk of human ovarian cancer and exogenous estradiol accelerates the onset of ovarian cancer in mouse models. This study uses primary cultures of mouse ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) to demonstrate that one possible mechanism by which estrogen accelerates the initiation of ovarian cancer is by up-regulation of microRNA-378 via the ESR1 pathway to result in the down-regulation of a tumour suppressor called Disabled-2 (Dab2). Estrogen suppression of Dab2 was reproducible in vivo and across many cell types including mouse oviductal epithelium and primary cultures of human ovarian cancer cells. Suppression of Dab2 resulted in increased proliferation, loss of contact inhibition, morphological dysplasia, and resistance to oncogene-induced senescence - all factors that can sensitize OSE to transformation. Given that DAB2 is highly expressed in healthy human OSE and is absent in the majority of ovarian tumours, this study has taken the first steps to provide a mechanistic explanation for how estrogen therapy may play a role in the initiation of ovarian cancer.

30945623	Carboplatin	Nausea	1	0	0	0		Short-course olanzapine to prevent delayed emesis following carboplatin/paclitaxel for gynecologic cancer: a randomised study.	PURPOSE: To explore efficacy of short-course olanzapine with or without low-dose dexamethasone for prevention of delayed emesis in gynecologic cancer patients receiving carboplatin/paclitaxel. METHODS: This was a prospective study in 81 chemo-naive patients receiving 0.25 mg intravenous palonosetron, 16 mg dexamethasone, and 10 mg oral olanzapine before chemotherapy. On days 2 and 3, patients randomly received 10 mg olanzapine (arm A; n=27), 10 mg olanzapine plus 4 mg dexamethasone (arm B; n=27), or 8 mg dexamethasone (reference arm C; n=27). The primary endpoint was total control (TC; no vomiting, no rescue antiemetics, and no nausea) on days 2-5, using a diary. Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients with no emesis impact on daily life using the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire, and patient's satisfaction with antiemetic coverage. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of patients in arm A (P=0.406), 59% in arm B (P=0.779), and 67% in arm C had a delayed TC. Secondary analyses showed no significant difference across arms in any efficacy endpoint. FLIE scores as well as mean satisfaction scores were similar across arms. CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory study with a small sample size, we did not find any clue about better control of delayed emesis with either olanzapine regimen in gynecologic cancer patients treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel and receiving the same prophylaxis for acute emesis.

30994776	Hydrogen Peroxide	Dentin Sensitivity	0	0	0	0		Effect of dental bleaching on pulp oxygen saturation in maxillary central incisors - a randomized clinical trial.	OBJECTIVE: To assess pulp oxygen saturation levels (SaO2) in maxillary central incisors after dental bleaching. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 80 participants (160 teeth) were randomly allocated to four groups: G1 In-office bleaching with two applications of 35% hydrogen peroxide (HP) (20 minutes), followed by at-home bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide (CP) (2 hours/day for 16 days); G2 - Same protocol as G1, plus desensitizing toothpaste; G3 - In-office bleaching with 35% HP and one application of placebo gel (20 minutes), followed by at-home bleaching with 10% CP (2 hours/day for 16 days); and G4 - Same protocol as G3, plus desensitizing toothpaste. Pulp SaO2 levels were measured before (T0) and immediately after (T1) in-office bleaching; on the 5th (T2), 8th (T3), 12th (T4), and 16th days of at-home bleaching (T5); and on the 7th (T6) and 30th (T7) days. Mean (SD) pulp SaO2 levels were compared within groups by generalized estimating equations (GEE) and Student's t-test (P<0.05). RESULTS: Mean pulp SaO2 at T0 was 84.29% in G1, 84.38% in G2, 84.79% in G3, and 85.83% in G4. At T1, these values decreased to 81.96%, 82.06%, 82.19%, and 81.15% in G1, G2, G3, and G4 respectively, with significant difference in G4 (P<0.05). During home bleaching, pulp SaO2 levels varied in all groups, with 86.55%, 86.60%, 85.71%, and 87.15% means at T7 for G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively; G2 presented significant difference (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pulp SaO2 level in maxillary central incisors was similar at baseline, reducing immediately after in-office bleaching, regardless of using desensitizing toothpaste and increasing at 30 days after dental bleaching.

30744989	Oseltamivir	Behavioral Symptoms	1	1	0	0	0.0	Association of severe abnormal behavior and acetaminophen with/without neuraminidase inhibitors.	BACKGROUND: Even though abnormal behavior related with influenza and neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) has been discussed, the risks of acetaminophen and co-administration of NI and acetaminophen have not been examined. This study assesses those risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of patients with influenza who present with severe abnormal behavior are reported by physicians of all clinics and hospitals throughout Japan. The numbers of people diagnosed as having influenza, whether prescribed NI and acetaminophen or not, were extracted from the National Database of Electronic Medical Claims (NDBEMC). The study period was from September 2009 to March 2016. RESULTS: We found two consistent results among four combinations of age class and severity. The one was that patients who did not use NI or acetaminophen showed significantly higher incidence of abnormal behavior than zanamivir with acetaminophen, another one was that patients with oseltamivir only has higher incidence than zanamivir with acetaminophen. Concerning about acetaminophen, the use of it significantly decrease risk for severe and the most severe instances in 5-9-year-old patients with laninamivir and the severe instances in 10-19-year-old patients with zanamivir. DISCUSSION: We also demonstrated that acetaminophen alone or co-administered with NI does not seem to raise the risk of abnormal behavior in influenza patients.

Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRI), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and anti-EGFR antibodies commonly develop skin toxicities including acneiform eruption (AfE). However, precise skin changes and risk factors for severe AfE are still unclear. The objective of the current study was elucidation of the useful parameters for early and sensitive detection of the skin changes by EGFRI. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin surface hydration, skin surface lipid levels and erythema/melanin index were serially measured for 2 weeks in 19 EGFR-TKI afatinib/erlotinib-treated patients and for 8 weeks in 20 anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab-treated patients. The TEWL levels of the cheek in the patients who developed AfE of grade 2 and more (AfE >/= Gr2) were already elevated at 7 days after the initiation of afatinib/erlotinib therapy compared with those before therapy as well as in patients with grade 1 or less (AfE </= Gr1). In patients treated with cetuximab, the skin surface hydration on the cheek in AfE >/= Gr2 patients significantly decreased compared with that of AfE </= Gr1 patients at the 2nd and 6th week. Baseline skin surface lipid levels and erythema index on the cheek of patients with AfE >/= Gr2 were significantly higher than those with AfE </= Gr1. The small sample size of the present study, especially for logistic regression analysis, is a limitation. In conclusion, instrumental evaluation declared rapid inflammatory changes of the skin by EGFRI and elucidated oily skin as a risk for severe AfE.

30947751	Iron-Dextran Complex	Acute Kidney Injury	0	1	0	0		Protocol and baseline data for a prospective open-label explorative randomized single-center comparative study to determine the effects of various intravenous iron preparations on markers of oxidative stress and kidney injury in chronic kidney disease (IRON-CKD).	"BACKGROUND: Intravenous (IV) iron is frequently used to treat iron deficiency/anemia in patients who are unable to tolerate oral iron or the oral iron is not sufficient toreplete iron requirements. However, safety concerns regarding the potential increase in oxidative stress and other adverse effects persist and it remains unclear whether all iron preparations are equivalent. Indeed, the comparative risk of adverse events with IV iron preparations has not been extensively assessed. We hypothesize that IV iron leads to changes in oxidative stress, endothelial function, and potential renal damage depending on the iron formulation (related to the generation of ""free"" or catalytic labile iron) and this may result in more tubular and glomerular injury manifested as increased proteinuria and raised neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: IRON-CKD is a prospective, open-label, explorative, randomized, single-center study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of three parenteral iron preparations: low-molecular-weight iron dextran-Cosmofer, iron sucrose-Venofer, and iron isomaltoside-Monofer. The study includes 40 adults who have established CKD stages 3-5 and serum ferritin (SF) of less than 200 mug/L or transferrin saturation (TS) of less than 20% (or both); they were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 200 mg iron dextran, 200 mg iron sucrose, 200 mg iron isomaltoside, or 1000 mg iron isomaltoside. After randomization, participants undergo baseline assessments and then an iron infusion. Each participant is followed up at 2 h, day 1, week 1, and months 1 and 3. At each follow-up visit, patients undergo clinical review, measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV), blood tests for renal function, and collection of serum/plasma samples for oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. The primary outcomes are measures of oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and markers of acute renal injury in comparison with baseline measures of each iron preparation and between each of the iron preparations. Secondary objectives include effects on hematinic profiles and hemoglobin concentrations, changes in arterial stiffness, incidence of significant side effects, and change in patients' quality of life. RESULTS: Between October 2015 and April 2018, 521 individuals were identified as potential participants; 216 were contacted, 56 expressed an interest, 49 attended a screening visit, and 40 were confirmed to meet the eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned. The mean age was 58.8 (standard error of the mean 2.2) years, and 23 (58%) were male. All patients were white and English-speaking. The mean SF was 68.8 mug/L, TS was 21.4%, and haemoglobin was 122.6 g/L at randomization for the whole group. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 28.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 the urinary protein/ creatinine ratio was 154.2 mg/mmol, and CRP was 7.5 mg/L. DISCUSSION: IRON-CKD will provide important information on the short-term effects of three preparations of IV iron in CKD patients with biochemical functional or absolute iron deficiency on measures of oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial function, and renal injury.

Loss of major histocompatibility Class II expression (MHCII) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) correlates with decreased survival. MHCII transcription is in part regulated by histone acetylation. We tested the hypothesis that combination of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) with standard chemotherapy would improve outcomes in DLBCL in part through increased MHCII expression. S0806 was a single arm phase I/II trial of vorinostat given at 400 mg po daily on days 1-9 (subsequently amended to days 1-5 due to toxicity), combined with R-CHOP given on day 3 of a 21-day cycle for 8 cycles, with primary phase II endpoint of 2-year progression free survival (PFS). With 72 evaluable patients, at median follow up of 3 years, 2-year PFS estimate was 73%, and OS estimate was 86%. Considering that the regimen fell short of predefined efficacy improvement and was associated with high rates of febrile neutropenia (38%) and sepsis (19%), it cannot be recommended for general use. Consistent with our hypothesis, patients with low MCHII expression on S0806 had numerically superior outcomes compared to those from trial S0433 which did not use an HDACI, but the difference was not statistically significant. Current studies are focused on finding biomarkers of response to HDACI.

Loss of major histocompatibility Class II expression (MHCII) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) correlates with decreased survival. MHCII transcription is in part regulated by histone acetylation. We tested the hypothesis that combination of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI) with standard chemotherapy would improve outcomes in DLBCL in part through increased MHCII expression. S0806 was a single arm phase I/II trial of vorinostat given at 400 mg po daily on days 1-9 (subsequently amended to days 1-5 due to toxicity), combined with R-CHOP given on day 3 of a 21-day cycle for 8 cycles, with primary phase II endpoint of 2-year progression free survival (PFS). With 72 evaluable patients, at median follow up of 3 years, 2-year PFS estimate was 73%, and OS estimate was 86%. Considering that the regimen fell short of predefined efficacy improvement and was associated with high rates of febrile neutropenia (38%) and sepsis (19%), it cannot be recommended for general use. Consistent with our hypothesis, patients with low MCHII expression on S0806 had numerically superior outcomes compared to those from trial S0433 which did not use an HDACI, but the difference was not statistically significant. Current studies are focused on finding biomarkers of response to HDACI.

29614517	Clopidogrel	Intracranial Hemorrhages	0	0	0	0		Prediction of Post-Discharge Bleeding in Elderly Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes: Insights from the BleeMACS Registry.	BACKGROUND: A poor ability of recommended risk scores for predicting in-hospital bleeding has been reported in elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). No study assessed the prediction of post-discharge bleeding in the elderly. The new BleeMACS score (Bleeding complications in a Multicenter registry of patients discharged with diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome), was designed to predict post-discharge bleeding in ACS patients. We aimed to assess the predictive ability of the BleeMACS score in elderly patients. METHODS: We assessed the incidence and characteristics of severe bleeding after discharge in ACS patients aged >/= 75 years. Bleeding was defined as any intracranial bleeding or bleeding leading to hospitalization and/or red blood transfusion, occurring within the first year after discharge. We assessed the predictive ability of the BleeMACS score according to age by Fine-Gray proportional hazards regression analysis, calculating receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curves (AUC). RESULTS: The BleeMACS registry included 15,401 patients of whom 3,376/15,401 (21.9%) were aged >/= 75 years. Elderly patients were more commonly treated with clopidogrel and less often treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel. Of 3,376 elderly patients, 190 (5.6%) experienced post-discharge bleeding. The incidence of bleeding was moderately higher in elderly patients (hazard ratio [HR], 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92-2.77). The predictive ability of the BleeMACS score was moderately lower in elderly patients (AUC, 0.652 vs. 0.691, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with ACS had a significantly higher incidence of post-discharge bleeding. Despite a lower predictive ability in older patients, the BleeMACS score exhibited an acceptable performance in these patients.

30851515	Methotrexate	Gastrointestinal Diseases	0	0	0	0		Comparison of combination therapy with methotrexate and sinomenine or leflunomide for active rheumatoid arthritis: A randomized controlled clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: A combination of conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs improves the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but with high side-effects. Methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy that with high therapeutic efficacy and low toxicity is in demand in many countries to replace the use of expensive biological agents. STUDY DESIGN: This study was an open-label, 24-week, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted between November 2015 and December 2017. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned at a 3:2 ratio to receive MTX combined with sinomenine (SIN) at a dose of 120 mg twice daily, or leflunomide (LEF) at a dose of 20 mg once daily. Efficacy and safety were assessed at weeks 4, 12 and 24. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR)50 response and a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response at week 24. RESULTS: A total of 101/120 (84.2%) patients completed 24 weeks of observation. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 65.3% of patients treated with MTX + SIN showed improved disease activity as determined by the ACR50 response at week 24 compared to 69.6% of patients treated with MTX + LEF. A similar insignificant pattern was found for the ACR20 and ACR70 responses, as well as the clinical disease activity index, EULAR response, and remission and low disease activity rates between these two treatment groups. The per-protocol analysis showed results consistent with those of the ITT analysis. Notably, significant reductions in gastrointestinal adverse reactions and liver toxicity were found in patients treated with MTX + SIN compared to patients treated with MTX + LEF (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Considering the balance of efficacy and toxicity, the current study provides evidence that MTX + SIN combination therapy is probably one of the choices for treating patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in addition to MTX + LEF combination therapy.
29727174	Vinyl Chloride	Obesity	0	0	0	0		Exposure to Vinyl Chloride and Its Influence on Western Diet-Induced Cardiac Remodeling.	Obesity, usually caused by high fat diets (HFD), is a major public health issue worldwide, causing obesity associated cardiomyopathy. Moreover, the environmental toxicant vinyl chloride (VC) can exacerbate HFD-induced fatty liver disease. However, whether VC serves to enhance obesity-associated cardiomyopathy remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the interaction of western diet (WD) containing relatively low fat (42%) with VC on cardiac remodeling and its underling mechanisms. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to WD coinhalation of low-dose VC (<1 ppm/d) for 12 weeks. Results showed that WD feeding for 12 weeks caused slight cardiac systolic dysfunction without significant hypertrophy or fibrosis, even with VC. Nevertheless, WD upregulated NF-kappaB function and expression of IL-1beta and PAI-1, while VC showed no significant impact on these effects. In contrast, WD together with VC significantly increased the expression of CHOP and TGF-beta1, key markers for endoplasmic reticulum stress and profibrotic cytokine, respectively. In summary, exposure to low-dose of environmental toxicant VC while a WD is consumed for a relatively short time does not have significant impact on cardiac remodeling except for a mild systolic dysfunction of the heart.

29757924	Ketamine	Respiratory Insufficiency	0	0	0	0		Placebo versus low-dose ketamine infusion in addition to remifentanil target-controlled infusion for conscious sedation during oocyte retrieval: A double-blinded, randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no gold standard for monitored anaesthesia care during oocyte retrieval. OBJECTIVE: In our institution, the standard is a conscious sedation technique using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of remifentanil, titrated to maintain a visual analogue pain score less than 30 mm. This protocol is well accepted by patients but is associated with frequent episodes of respiratory depression. The main objective of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of a continuous intravenous infusion of ketamine could reduce these episodes. DESIGN: Controlled, randomised, prospective, double-blinded study. SETTING: The current study was conducted in a tertiary-level hospital in Brussels (Belgium) from December 2013 to June 2014. PATIENTS: Of the 132 women undergoing oocyte retrieval included, 121 completed the study. INTERVENTION: After randomisation, patients received either a ketamine infusion (40 mug kg min over 5 min followed by 2.5 mug kg min) or a 0.9% saline infusion in addition to the variable remifentanil TCI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the number of respiratory depression episodes. Effect site target remifentanil concentrations, side effects, pain score, patient satisfaction and incidence of pregnancy were also recorded. RESULTS: No significant difference in the incidence of respiratory events was noted (pulse oximetry oxygen saturation < 95% was 49% in the ketamine group and 63% in the control group; P = 0.121). No patient required ventilatory support. In the ketamine group, visual analogue pain score and remifentanil concentrations were significantly reduced, but the latter remained above 2 ng ml. Postoperative nausea was less frequent in the ketamine group, 4 versus 15% (P = 0.038). The addition of ketamine did not influence length of stay nor patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The addition of low plasma levels of ketamine to a TCI remifentanil conscious sedation technique did not decrease the incidence nor the severity of respiratory depression. Continuous monitoring of capnography and oxygen saturation is always required. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EUDRACT number 2013-003040-23.
29575671	Rituximab	Hepatitis C	1	1	0	0	0.0	Rituximab May Cause Increased Hepatitis C Virus Viremia in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Through Declining Exosomal MicroRNA-155.	OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown that rituximab may enhance hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in modulating the host immune response in HCV infection; miRNAs can be packaged into the exosomes and then shuttled by the exosomes to aid biologic functions. However, the role of exosomal miRNAs (exo-miRNAs) in rituximab-related HCV activity enhancement remains unclear. METHODS: The association between rituximab and increased HCV activity was examined using an in vitro cell-based assay. Purified exosomes were confirmed using immunoblotting and flow cytometry and quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Exosomal miRNA-155 (exo-miR-155) levels were measured using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In vitro data showed that B cell-derived miR-155 could inhibit HCV replication in hepatocytes through exosome transmission. Rituximab could both induce B cell depletion and affect intracellular miR-155 production as well as exo-miR-155 transmission and then enhance HCV activity in hepatocytes (P < 0.005). Serum exosome levels were increased in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with HCV infection compared with the levels in RA patients without HCV infection (P < 0.01). The exo-miR-155 levels were significantly increased in RA patients with HCV infection compared with those without infection (P < 0.01). A significantly greater decrement of exo-miR-155 expression was observed after rituximab therapy compared with those observed before therapy (P < 0.01), and hepatitis C viral loads increased simultaneously (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Circulating exo-miR-155 levels were negatively correlated with hepatitis C viral loads and subsequently associated with rituximab-related HCV activity enhancement in RA patients. Exo-miR-155 may become a potential diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target.
31009289	Tolterodine Tartrate	Xerostomia	0	0	0	0		Efficacy and Safety of Tolterodine and Pilocarpine in Patients with Overactive Bladder.	PURPOSE: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a combination of 2 mg tolterodine and 9 mg pilocarpine, vs tolterodine monotherapy in patients with overactive bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled patients with overactive bladder symptoms in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, active control study. Patients were randomized to the combination or 2 mg tolterodine twice daily for 12 weeks. After the double-blind period finished all patients were started on the combination for 12 weeks. Study co-primary end points were the change from baseline in the mean number of daily micturitions and cumulative incidence of dry mouth at the end of 12 weeks. Secondary end points were other overactive bladder symptoms, the total xerostomia inventory score and results of a visual analogue scale for dry mouth at the end of 12 and 24 weeks. RESULTS: The mean change in the number of daily micturitions from baseline to 12 weeks was -1.49 and -1.74 in the combination and tolterodine monotherapy groups, respectively. The mean difference was -0.26 (95% CI -0.79-0.27), confirming noninferiority. At 12 weeks the incidence of dry mouth was lower in the combination group than in the tolterodine monotherapy group (30.0% vs 42.9%, p = 0.009). All secondary and other efficacy outcomes related to overactive bladder symptoms improved in each group with no significant differences between the groups at 12 weeks. Changes from baseline in the total xerostomia inventory score and the visual analogue scale for dry mouth were significantly lower in the combination group than in the tolterodine monotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine and pilocarpine alleviated dry mouth in patients with overactive bladder while maintaining anticholinergic efficacy similar to that of tolterodine.
29968917	Hydrochlorothiazide	Photosensitivity Disorders	1	1	0	0	0.0	Inflammation Due to Voriconazole-induced Photosensitivity Enhanced Skin Phototumorigenesis in Xpa-knockout Mice.	Voriconazole is an antifungal agent and used as a prophylactic measure, especially in immunocompromised patients. However, there have been several reports of its adverse reactions, namely photosensitivity with intense inflammatory rashes and subsequent skin cancer development. To assess the effects of photosensitizing drugs voriconazole and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) on the enhancement of UV-induced inflammatory responses and UV-induced tumorigenesis, we utilized Xpa-knockout mice, which is DNA repair-deficient and more susceptible to UV-induced inflammation and tumor development than wild-type mice. Administration of voriconazole prior to broadband UVB exposure significantly upregulated multiple inflammatory cytokines compared with the vehicle- or HCTZ-administered groups. Voriconazole administration along with chronic UVB exposure produced significantly higher number of skin tumors than HCTZ or vehicle in Xpa-knockout mice. Furthermore, the investigation of UVB-induced DNA damage using embryonic fibroblasts of Xpa-knockout mice revealed a significantly higher 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine level in cells treated with voriconazole N-oxide, a voriconazole-metabolite during UV exposure. The data suggest that voriconazole plus UVB-induced inflammatory response may be related to voriconazole-induced skin phototumorigenesis.

29114903	Cefuroxime	Anaphylaxis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Occupational generalized urticaria and anaphylaxis after inhalation of cefuroxime in a nurse.	We present the case of a 53 years old nonatopic female nurse who experienced repeated anaphylactic reactions at work without involvement in drug-specific tasks such as crushing of tablets or preparation of injections. The causal allergen was not identified until a further severe anaphylactic reaction occurred after oral use of cefuroxime during a respiratory infection. Sensitization to cefuroxime was demonstrated by specific IgE, basophil activation test and skin prick test. An inhalation challenge with a dosimeter induced generalized urticaria after a cumulative dose of about 10 mug of the drug, but no asthmatic reaction. Complete exposure cessation was initiated and a 1-year follow-up was without further allergic reactions. We conclude that work-related systemic allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics may occur in nurses after inhalation of low doses and without perceived association with drug-specific tasks like handling of antibiotics.

30771745	Selenium	Skin Neoplasms	0	0	0	0		Changes in blood pressure associated with lead, manganese, and selenium in a Bangladeshi cohort.	BACKGROUND: Heavy metal contamination is widespread in Bangladesh. Previous studies have observed lead increases blood pressure over time. However, the role of other metal contaminants and essential micronutrients, which could also adversely affect blood pressure or act as protective factors, is understudied. OBJECTIVES: We therefore evaluated the associations of lead, manganese, and selenium with blood and pulse pressure trajectories. METHODS: We prospectively followed placebo-assigned participants nested within a randomized trial for the prevention of arsenic-related skin cancer (n = 255). Blood lead, manganese, and selenium were measured at baseline; blood pressure was measured at baseline and at 3 biennial follow-up examinations. Mixed-effect linear regression models were used to estimate associations with average annual changes in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. RESULTS: In models simultaneously adjusted for baseline blood lead, manganese, and selenium concentrations in addition to other potential confounders, lead was linearly associated with increases in systolic blood pressure, but not with diastolic blood pressure or pulse pressure. A non-linear association was observed for manganese, such that mid-range concentrations were associated with decreases in systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. Baseline selenium concentrations in the highest quartile were also associated with longitudinal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while null associations were observed with pulse pressure. In exploratory analyses, the combination of mid-range manganese and high selenium concentrations completely offset lead-associated increases in blood and pulse pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a direct, linear association of lead exposure with systolic blood pressure, and manganese and selenium exposures within certain ranges may have a blood pressure-lowering effect in this population.
29022756	Nitric Oxide	Migraine Disorders	0	1	0	0		Soluble guanylyl cyclase is a critical regulator of migraine-associated pain.	Background Nitric oxide (NO) has been heavily implicated in migraine. Nitroglycerin is a prototypic NO-donor, and triggers migraine in humans. However, nitroglycerin also induces oxidative/nitrosative stress and is a source of peroxynitrite - factors previously linked with migraine etiology. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is the high affinity NO receptor in the body, and the aim of this study was to identify the precise role of sGC in acute and chronic migraine. Methods We developed a novel brain-bioavailable sGC stimulator (VL-102), and tested its hyperalgesic properties in mice. We also determined the effect of VL-102 on c-fos and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity within the trigeminovascular complex. In addition, we also tested the known sGC inhibitor, ODQ, within the chronic nitroglycerin migraine model. Results VL-102-evoked acute and chronic mechanical cephalic and hind-paw allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, which was blocked by the migraine medications sumatriptan, propranolol, and topiramate. In addition, VL-102 also increased c-fos and CGRP expressing cells within the trigeminovascular complex. Importantly, ODQ completely inhibited acute and chronic hyperalgesia induced by nitroglycerin. ODQ also blocked hyperalgesia already established by chronic nitroglycerin, implicating this pathway in migraine chronicity. Conclusions These results indicate that nitroglycerin causes migraine-related pain through stimulation of the sGC pathway, and that super-activation of this receptor may be an important component for the maintenance of chronic migraine. This work opens the possibility for negative sGC modulators as novel migraine therapies.
28926514	Estrogens	Candidiasis, Vulvovaginal	0	0	0	0		A randomized, multicenter, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of estradiol vaginal cream 0.003% in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom.	OBJECTIVE: Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is characterized by vaginal changes, dyspareunia, and itching/irritation. Efficacy and safety of a lower-dose estradiol vaginal cream (0.003%) were evaluated in postmenopausal women with VVA-related dyspareunia. METHODS: This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sexually active postmenopausal women with moderate-severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome symptom, </=5% vaginal superficial cells, and vaginal pH >5.0 were randomized (1:1) to 0.003% estradiol vaginal cream (15 mug estradiol; 0.5 g cream) or placebo (0.5 g cream) applied daily for 2 weeks followed by three applications/week for 10 weeks. Coprimary outcomes were changes in dyspareunia severity, vaginal cytology, and vaginal pH from baseline to final assessment. Additional efficacy outcomes and safety were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 550 participants (average age, 58 y) were randomized. Compared with placebo, estradiol reduced dyspareunia severity (mean change from baseline +/- SD: -1.5 +/- 1.0 estradiol vs -1.2 +/- 0.9 placebo), decreased vaginal pH (-1.36 +/- 0.89 vs -0.53 +/- 0.92), and improved vaginal cytology (percentage superficial and parabasal cells 10.1 +/- 16.7 vs 1.4 +/- 6.1 and -48.5 +/- 45.1 vs -14.6 +/- 39.6; P < 0.001, all) at the final assessment. In addition, estradiol decreased dyspareunia severity at weeks 8 and 12, vaginal/vulvar irritation/itching at weeks 4 and 12, and dryness at week 12 versus placebo (P < 0.01, all). VVA severity, pH, and cytology improved at week 12 with estradiol versus placebo (P < 0.001, all). Vulvovaginal mycotic infections were more frequent with estradiol. One serious event leading to discontinuation occurred with estradiol. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Lower-dose estradiol vaginal cream (0.003%) dosed three applications/week is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for VVA-related dyspareunia.

Cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin represent the backbone of platinum therapy for several malignancies including head and neck, lung, colorectal, ovarian, breast, and genitourinary cancer. However, the efficacy of platinum-based drugs is often compromised by a plethora of severe toxicities including sensory and enteric neuropathy. Acute and chronic neurotoxicity following platinum chemotherapy is a major constraint, contributing to dose-reductions, treatment delays, and cessation of treatment. Identifying drugs that effectively prevent these toxic complications is imperative to improve the efficacy of anti-cancer treatment and patient quality of life. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been highlighted as key players in the pathophysiology of platinum chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a nuclear enzyme activated upon DNA damage, has demonstrated substantial sensory and enteric neuroprotective capacity when administered in combination with platinum chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, administration of PARP inhibitors alongside platinum chemotherapy has been found to significantly improve progression-free survival in patients with breast and ovarian cancer when compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone. This review summarises the current knowledge surrounding mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress in platinum chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and highlights a potential role for PARP in chemopotentiation and neuroprotection.

Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a nuclear enzyme activated upon DNA damage, has demonstrated substantial sensory and enteric neuroprotective capacity when administered in combination with platinum chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, administration of PARP inhibitors alongside platinum chemotherapy has been found to significantly improve progression-free survival in patients with breast and ovarian cancer when compared to those receiving chemotherapy alone. This review summarises the current knowledge surrounding mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress in platinum chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and highlights a potential role for PARP in chemopotentiation and neuroprotection.

30521934	Benserazide	Parkinson Disease, Secondary	1	0	0	0		Implication of nigral dopaminergic lesion and repeated L-dopa exposure in neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease.	This study aims to investigate the contribution of nigral dopaminergic (DA) cell loss, repeated exposure to DA medication and the combination of both to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). A bilateral 6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) was performed in rats. A set of animals was repeatedly administered with L-dopa (20 mg/kg/day) and benserazide (5 mg/kg/day) over 10 days starting from day 11 post-lesion. Behavioural testing was performed in week 3 post-lesion: novel object recognition (NOR), elevated plus maze (EPM) social interaction (SI) tests, and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AIH). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant partial lesion (48%) in 6-OHDA versus sham rats. This lesion was not associated with motor impairment. However, lesioned rats displayed a significant deficit in the NOR, which was reversed by acute treatment with l-dopa/benserazide (12.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg respectively). Lesioned rats also displayed a deficit in the EPM which was not reversed by acute treatment with l-dopa. No difference was observed in the SI test or in the AIH assay. In all assays, no effect of chronic l-dopa exposure was observed. This study provides new insights into the neuropathophysiology associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD. Our data strongly emphasises a not previously clearly identified critical role in cognition for the SNc. The results suggest that DA pathways were less directly involved in lesion-induced anxiety-like behaviour. We did not report any effect of chronic l-dopa exposure in the context of partial nigral cell loss.

29731407	Atazanavir Sulfate	Cardiovascular Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Cardiovascular disease and use of contemporary protease inhibitors: the D:A:D international prospective multicohort study.	BACKGROUND: Although earlier protease inhibitors have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whether this increased risk also applies to more contemporary protease inhibitors is unknown. We aimed to assess whether cumulative use of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and ritonavir-boosted darunavir were associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV. METHODS: The prospective Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study consists of people living with HIV-1 from 11 cohorts in Australia, Europe, and the USA. Participants were monitored from Jan 1, 2009, until the earliest of a cardiovascular event, 6 months after the last visit, or until Feb 1, 2016. The outcome of interest was the incidence of cardiovascular disease in adults (aged >/=16 years) living with HIV who were being treated with contemporary treatments. We defined cardiovascular disease as centrally validated myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden cardiac death, or use of invasive cardiovascular procedures, including coronary bypass, coronary angioplasty, and carotid endarterectomy. We used Poisson regression models to assess the associations between cardiovascular disease and the contempoary protease inhibitors atazanavir and darunavir (both boosted with ritonavir). FINDINGS: 49 709 participants were enrolled in the original cohort from 1999 onwards; 35 711 (71.8%) participants with available data on CD4 cell count and viral load at the 2009 baseline were included in the current analysis, and 13 998 (28.2%) participants had insufficent follow-up data after 2009. During a median 6.96 years of follow-up (IQR 6.28-7.08), 1157 people developed cardiovascular disease (incidence rate 5.34 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI 5.03-5.65). The incidence rate of cardiovascular disease progressively increased from 4.91 events per 1000 person-years (4.59-5.23) in individuals unexposed to ritonavir-boosted darunavir to 13.67 events per 1000 person-years (8.51-18.82) in those exposed to the drug for more than 6 years. The changes associated with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir were less pronounced, showing an incidence rate of 5.03 cardiovascular events per 1000 person-years (4.69-5.37) in unexposed individuals to 6.68 events per 1000 person-years (5.02-8.35) in participants exposed for more than 6 years. After adjustment, keeping factors on the potential causal pathway from boosted protease inhibitor use to cardiovascular disease fixed at baseline, ritonavir-boosted darunavir use was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (incidence rate ratio 1.59; 95% CI 1.33-1.91 per 5 years additional use), but use of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir was not (1.03; 0.90-1.18). This association remained after adjustment for time-updated factors on the potential causal pathway; myocardial infarction and stroke separately; plasma bilirubin concentration; and after stratification by use of ritonavir-boosted darunavir as the first ever protease inhibitor, used in combination with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, by previous virological failure, and by those at high risk of cardiovascular disease. INTERPRETATION: Cumulative use of ritonavir-boosted darunavir, but not of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, is associated with progressively increasing risk of cardiovascular disease. Causal inference is limited by the observational nature of the D:A:D study. Our findings should prompt investigation into the possible underlying mechanisms of this finding. FUNDING: The Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy Oversight Committee.
30362203	Meperidine	Obstetric Labor Complications	0	0	0	0		Safety and efficacy of a combination of pethidine and levallorphan for pain relief during labor: An observational study.	AIM: To evaluate the safety, effect on breastfeeding and efficacy of a combination of pethidine and levallorphan (Pethilorfan) for pain relief during labor. METHODS: We compared maternal or neonatal morbidities, suckling difficulties in newborns and breastfeeding rates between 177 women who received 50-200 mg (as pethidine) of Pethilorfan during labor (Pethilorfan group) and 354 women who delivered their infants without analgesic drugs immediately before or after each woman in the Pethilorfan group (control group) from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2016. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses for comparison between the two groups. We also evaluated the efficacy of Pethilorfan retrospectively. RESULTS: The Pethilorfan group included more women with prolonged and/or operative deliveries than the control group. Nevertheless, no significant differences were seen between the two groups in the rates of Apgar scores less than 7 at 1 or 5 min, composite neonatal morbidities, hyperbilirubinemia or respiratory disturbances. The incidence of suckling difficulties lasting over 24 h and the breastfeeding rates at discharge or after 1 month were also similar. Maternal adverse effects of Pethilorfan were generally mild and transient. The efficacy ratio of Pethilorfan was 83.6%, although its analgesic effect was usually incomplete. CONCLUSION: Pethilorfan can be used safely for labor pain relief without increasing maternal or neonatal morbidities, or impeding breastfeeding, if it is administered at a prudent dosage. Parenteral opioids including Pethilorfan should remain as an option for treating women in labor pain, particularly when epidural analgesia is not readily available or contraindicated.
30868068	Nevirapine	Dyslipidemias	1	1	0	0	0.0	Changes in Lipid Indices in HIV+ Cases on HAART.	We assess long-term changes in lipid levels in human immunodeficiency disease- (HIV-) infected patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) and their association with diabetes mellitus (DM) and thyroid dysfunction. We observed changes in the levels of total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) of 63 HIV-infected patients in the 6 years from starting HAART and analyzed correlations between relevant parameters. TC levels of patients with normal baseline TC levels as well as those diagnosed with DM or impaired fasting glucose (IFG) increased significantly (P  < 0.05) as did the TG levels of patients with normal baseline TG levels (P  < 0.05). TC levels of patients with hypercholesterolemia in the year HAART was initiated were significantly higher than those of patients with normal baseline TC levels (P  < 0.05) for all 6 years. TC levels of patients diagnosed with DM were significantly higher than those with euglycemia (P  < 0.05) 2 and 4 years after HAART commencement. Levels of TC, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were correlated negatively with viral load, whereas levels of TC and very-low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) were correlated positively with CD4+ cell counts before HAART commencement. Linear mixed-effect model demonstrated disturbance of glucose metabolism and HAART containing nevirapine and CD4+ cell count were positively correlated with TC levels after HAART commencement. These findings suggest that there are changes in the lipid levels of patients undergoing HAART, with the potential risk of dyslipidemia.
28267111	Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate	Arterial Occlusive Diseases	1	1	0	1	1.0	BLIND-SIDED BY COSMETIC VEIN SCLEROTHERAPY: A CASE OF OPHTHALMIC ARTERIAL OCCLUSION.	PURPOSE: Cosmetic vein sclerotherapy is increasingly used to treat varicose veins because of its effectiveness and adherence with British Pharmacopoeia specifications. We present the first documented case of ophthalmic artery occlusion resulting in panocular ischemia secondary to intravascular injection of sodium tetradecyl sulfate sclerosant in a young healthy women seeking treatment for prominent facial veins in her forehead. METHODS: The patient presented with unilateral sudden loss of vision. Funduscopy demonstrated a pale retina, cherry-red spot, and sclerosant visualized directly at the macula. She underwent emergency treatment for central retinal artery occlusion followed by fundal photographs, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography. RESULTS: Despite intervention, the vision remained no perception to light. Magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and Doppler ultrasound were unremarkable. The patient later developed neovascular sequelae requiring laser pan-retinal photocoagulation. CONCLUSION: Widely regarded as safe, and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the only published ocular side effects of foam sclerotherapy are transient visual disturbances or temporary scotomas. This case demonstrates irreversible loss of vision as a previously unreported complication. While undoubtedly rare, we believe physicians and surgeons using sclerosant in the orbital adnexa, face, nose, and sinuses should be aware of this sight-threatening complication of injection and counsel potential patients accordingly.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a commonly used and often effective class of medications in the treatment of mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. Sertraline (1S,4S-N-methyl-4-[3,4-dichlorophenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthylamine [Zoloft; Pfizer, New York City, NY]) is a frequently used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that has shown efficacy in children, adolescents, and adults. We report the case of a 13-year-old boy with sertraline-induced rhabdomyolysis and renal failure, trismus, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Pharmacogenetic testing later revealed our patient had serotonin transporter polymorphisms and enzymatic alterations that put him at risk for increased levels of sertraline and greater likelihood for untoward side effects.
30765674	Cyclophosphamide	Lung Diseases, Interstitial	1	1	0	0	0.0	[A Case of Drug-Induced Interstitial Lung Disease Associated with Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide Therapy before Operation].	We report the case of a 60-year-old woman with right breast cancer. Approximately 18 years had passed since the treatment for left breast cancer without recurrence. She became aware of the right breast tumor with mild pain 5 months before she came to the hospital. The diagnosis was right-sided breast cancer, cT2N0M0, StageⅡA, ER(-), PgR(-), HER2(-). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was chosen, and then combined treatment with epirubicin(EPI)and cyclophosphamide(CPA) was started. The breast tumor had become smaller, but she complained of shortness of breath during the third course of chemotherapy. On the basis of her history of cancer onset, chest CT findings, and increase in serum SP-D levels, the combined therapy with EPI and CPA was suspected as the cause of the drug-induced interstitial lung disease(DILD). For this reason, the therapy was discontinued. After her recovery from this state, the operation(partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy)was performed. S-1 was used as postoperative adjuvant therapy, and the respiratory symptoms did not recur or worsen. On the basis of the disease course, we made a diagnosis of DILD with EPI and CPA. Many anticancer drugs may cause DILD. In case of a suspicion of DILD onset, a prompt diagnosis and an appropriate treatment are important.
30497387	Clopidogrel	Hemorrhage	0	0	0	0		Compared efficacy of clopidogrel and ticagrelor in treating acute coronary syndrome: a meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ticagrelor has been acknowledged as a new oral antagonist of P2Y12-adenosine diphosphate receptor, as a strategy with more rapid onset as well as more significant platelet inhibition function in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. The clinical benefit of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel remains controversial. The current meta-analysis was conducted to better evaluate the role of ticagrelor in comparison of clopidogrel in treating ACS patients. METHODS: The publications involving the safety as well as the efficacy of clopidogrel versus ticagrelor were screened and identified updated to June 2018. After rigorous review, eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were extracted and propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was conducted. To analyze the summary odds ratios (ORs) of the endpoints of interest, we applied Meta-analysis Revman 5.3 software. RESULTS: There were a total of 10 studies that met our inclusion criteria, of which the risk of bleeding rate (P = 0.43), MI (P = 0.14), and stroke (P = 0.70) had no association with significant differences between patients receiving ticagrelor or clopidogrel. Nonetheless, higher rate of dyspnea was observed in ticagrelor group (OR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.70-2.05, P<0.00001 = . CONCLUSIONS: Our present findings suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles for clopidogrel and ticagrelor Ticagrelor should be considered as a valuable option to reduce the risk of bleeding, MI and stroke, whereas potentially increases the incidence of dyspnea. Given the metabolic process, ticagrelor may be a valid and even more potent antiplatelet drug than clopidogrel, as an alternative strategy in treating patients with clopidogrel intolerance or resistance.

29981307	Reserpine	Blepharoptosis	0	1	0	0		Monoamine system disruption induces functional somatic syndromes associated symptomatology in mice.	Functional somatic syndromes (FSS), a clinical condition manifesting a variety of unexplained somatic symptoms, has been proposed as an inclusive nosology encompassing individual syndromes such as fibromyalgia syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. Accumulating evidence suggests that disturbance of the endogenous monoamine system could be involved in the aetiology of FSS. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to investigate whether the disturbance of the monoamine system would cause FSS-associated symptomatology in mice. The optimal dose of reserpine, an inducer of endogenous monoamines reduction, was first explored in mice. General body condition (body weight, rectal temperature, and ptosis) and FSS-associated symptomatology (paw withdrawal threshold, small intestinal transit, and locomotor activity) were measured. The concentration of monoamines was measured in central and peripheral tissues. Mice dosed with reserpine (0.25 mg/kg s.c., once daily for 3 consecutive days) exhibited a decrease in paw withdrawal threshold, delay in small intestinal transit, and reduction of locomotor activity without deterioration of general body condition on day 5 after the first reserpine injection. The concentration of monoamines was decreased in the central nervous system and skeletal muscle, but not in the small intestine. A reserpine dose of 0.5 mg/kg or more caused deterioration of general body condition. In conclusion, the optimal protocol of reserpine treatment for inducing pain symptom without deterioration of general physical condition is 0.25 mg/kg s.c., once daily for 3 consecutive days in mice. This protocol causes not only pain but also FSS-associated symptomatology which are associated with disruption of the endogenous monoamine system. The reserpine-treated animal may be useful for the research of not only fibromyalgia syndrome but also FSS, especially for the research focusing on the hypothesis that FSS is associated with the disturbance of endogenous monoamine system.
30280317	Selenium	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	0	1	0	0		Environmental Selenium and Human Health: an Update.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Selenium, a trace element, is ubiquitous in the environment. The main source of human exposure is diet. Despite its nutritional benefits, it is one of the most toxic naturally occurring elements. Selenium deficiency and overexposure have been associated with adverse health effects. Its level of toxicity may depend on its chemical form, as inorganic and organic species have distinct biological properties. RECENT FINDINGS: Nonexperimental and experimental studies have generated insufficient evidence for a role of selenium deficiency in human disease, with the exception of Keshan disease, a cardiomyopathy. Conversely, recent randomized trials have indicated that selenium overexposure is positively associated with type 2 diabetes and high-grade prostate cancer. In addition, a natural experiment has suggested an association between overexposure to inorganic hexavalent selenium and two neurodegenerative diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Risk assessments should be revised to incorporate the results of studies demonstrating toxic effects of selenium. Additional observational studies and secondary analyses of completed randomized trials are needed to address the uncertainties regarding the health risks of selenium exposure.

29504153	Irinotecan	Diarrhea	1	0	0	0		Relevance of CYP3A4*20, UGT1A1*37 and UGT1A1*28 variants in irinotecan-induced severe toxicity.	Severe irinotecan-induced toxicity is associated with UGT1A1 polymorphisms. However, some patients develop side-effects despite harbouring a normal UGT1A1 genotype. As CYP3A4 is also an irinotecan-metabolizing enzyme, our study aimed to elucidate the influence of the CYP3A4*20 loss-of-function allele in the toxicity profile of these patients. Three-hundred and eight metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with an irinotecan-containing chemotherapy were studied. The presence of CYP3A4*20, UGT1A1*37 and UGT1A1*28 alleles was tested. Associations between these genetic variants and toxicity were evaluated. UGT1A1*28 was significantly associated with severe diarrhoea, neutropenia and asthenia (P = 0.002, P = 0.037 and P = 0.041, respectively). One patient with the UGT1A1*28/*37 genotype presented with grade IV neutropenia and lethal septic shock. One heterozygous UGT1A1 (*1/*28) patient also carried the CYP3A4*20 allele but did not develop toxicity. We confirm that UGT1A1*37 and UGT1A1*28 are associated with severe toxicity and suggest that the CYP3A4*20 allele does not play a role in irinotecan-induced toxicity.

29127344	Parathyroid Hormone	Bone Resorption	0	1	0	0		Catabolic Effects of Human PTH (1-34) on Bone: Requirement of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 in Murine Model of Hyperparathyroidism.	The bone catabolic actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) are seen in patients with hyperparathyroidism, or with infusion of PTH in rodents. We have previously shown that the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), is a mediator of PTH's anabolic effects on bone. To determine its role in PTH's catabolic effects, we continuously infused female wild-type (WT) and MCP-1(-/-) mice with hPTH or vehicle. Microcomputed tomography (microCT) analysis of cortical bone showed that hPTH-infusion induced significant bone loss in WT mice. Further, muCT analysis of trabecular bone revealed that, compared with the vehicle-treated group, the PTH-treated WT mice had reduced trabecular thickness and trabecular number. Notably, MCP-1(-/-) mice were protected against PTH-induced cortical and trabecular bone loss as well as from increases in serum CTX (C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of type I collagen) and TRACP-5b (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b). In vitro, bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) from MCP-1(-/-) and WT mice were cultured with M-CSF, RANKL and/or MCP-1. BMMs from MCP-1(-/-) mice showed decreased multinucleated osteoclast formation compared with WT mice. Taken together, our work demonstrates that MCP-1 has a role in PTH's catabolic effects on bone including monocyte and macrophage recruitment, osteoclast formation, bone resorption, and cortical and trabecular bone loss.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to identify predictive factors of toxicity of docetaxel, platin, 5-fluorouracil (TPF) induction chemotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 2009 to March 2015, 57 patients treated consecutively with TPF were included retrospectively. There were 47 males (83%), the median age was 56 years [40-71 years]. Thirty-eight patients (67%) were treated for inoperable cancer (highly symptomatic and/or high tumor burden) and 19 (33%) were treated for laryngeal preservation. There were 47% stage IVa, 32% stage III and 21% stage IVb. At diagnosis, there were 53% stable weight, 28% grade 1 weight loss, 17% grade 2 weight loss and 2% grade 3 weight loss. RESULTS: Forty-seven percent of patients were in partial response after TPF, 28% in complete response, 7% stable, 2% progressing and 2% discordant response. The possibility of oral feeding without a feeding tube was predictive of a better response (P=0.02). Thirty-nine percent of patients increased weight during TPF, 35% were stable, 18% in grade 1 weight loss, 6% in grade 2 and 2% in grade 3. Six of the patients (10.5%) died during chemotherapy: four from febrile neutropenia, one from pneumopathy and one of unknown cause. Age 57years and older was associated with a higher risk of grade>/=3 anemia and thrombocytopenia. There was a higher risk of grade>/=3 infection for weight loss at diagnosis (P=0.04) and feeding tube (P=0.05). There was a higher risk of grade>/=3 neutropenia for weight loss during TPF (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Induction chemotherapy by TPF has an strong anti-tumor efficacy (75.5% objective response) but an important morbidity with 10% toxic deaths in our very symptomatic population with a very important tumor burden. Age and nutritional status are important factors to consider.

29616864	Tretinoin	Headache	0	0	0	0		A phase-1 study of dasatinib plus all-trans retinoic acid in acute myeloid leukemia.	Src family kinases (SFKs) are hyperactivated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SFKs impede the retinoic acid receptor, and SFK inhibitors enhance all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-mediated cellular differentiation in AML cell lines and primary blasts. To translate these findings into the clinic, we undertook a phase-I dose-escalation study of the combination of the SFK inhibitor dasatinib and ATRA in patients with high-risk myeloid neoplasms. Nine subjects were enrolled: six received 70 mg dasatinib plus 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily, and three received 100 mg dasatinib plus 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily for 28 days. Headache and QTc prolongations were the only two grade 3 adverse events observed. No significant clinical responses were observed. We conclude that the combination of 70 mg dasatinib and 45 mg/m(2) ATRA daily is safe with acceptable toxicity. Our results provide the safety profile for further investigations into the clinical efficacy of this combination therapy in myeloid malignancies.
30071529	Methadone	Arrhythmias, Cardiac	1	1	0	0	0.0	Opioids and Cardiac Arrhythmia: A Literature Review.	OBJECTIVE: One of the most important side effects of opioids is their influence on the electrical activity of the heart. This review focusses on the effects of opioids on QT interval prolongation and their arrhythmogenic liability. METHODS: By using various keywords, papers published up to 2018 in different databases were searched and identified. The search terms were opioids names, corrected QT interval, human-ether-a-go-go gene, torsades de pointes (TdP), cardiac arrhythmias, opioid dependence and other relevant terms. It emphasized the effects of each opioid agent alone on electrocardiogram (ECG) and some interactions. RESULTS: Available data indicate that some opioids such as methadone are high-risk even at low doses, and have potential for prolongation of the QT interval and development of TdP, a dangerous ventricular tachycardia. A number of opioids such as tramadol and oxycodone are intermediate risk drugs and may develop long QT interval and TdP in high doses. Some other opioids such as morphine and buprenorphine are low-risk drugs and do not produce QT interval prolongation and TdP at least in routine doses. Opium-consumers are at higher risk of supra-ventricular arrhythmias, sinus bradycardia, cardiac block and atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSION: The cardiac arrhythmogenicity of various opioids is different. Methadone has a higher capability to induce long QT interval and dangerous arrhythmias in conventional doses than others. To reduce of arrhythmogenic risk, high doses of opioids must be used cautiously with periodic monitoring of ECG in high-risk consumers such as patients under opioid maintenance treatment.

30280426	Vemurafenib	Photosensitivity Disorders	1	1	0	0	0.0	Systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence of dermatological toxicities associated with vemurafenib treatment in patients with melanoma.	BACKGROUND: Vemurafenib has been linked to dermatological adverse events in patients with melanoma, including an increased risk of rash, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, photosensitivity reaction and keratoacanthoma. However, there has been no systematic attempt to assess the dermatological toxicity data of vemurafenib associated with melanoma treatment. AIM: To evaluate the point prevalence of dermatological toxicities associated with vemurafenib treatment in patients with melanoma. METHODS: Searches were conducted of the electronic databases PubMed and EMBASE and of conference abstracts published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Eligible studies included prospective clinical trials and expanded-access programmes (i.e. outside a clinical trial) of patients with melanoma assigned to vemurafenib treatment. Outcomes included prevalence of dermatological toxicities treated with vemurafenib. Statistical analyses were performed using the R2.8.1 meta package. RESULTS: In total, 11 studies comprising 4197 patients were included in the meta-analysis. For patients assigned to vemurafenib, the overall prevalence of all-grade cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) was 18.00% (95% CI 12.00-26.00%), rash 45.00% (95% CI 34.00-57.00%), photosensitivity reaction (PR) 30.00% (95% CI 23.00-38.00%), keratoacanthoma (KA) 10.00% (95% CI 6.00-15.00%) and hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) 9.00% (95% CI 4.00-20.00%), while the prevalence of high-grade events was: cSCC 16.00% (95% CI 11.00-23.00%), rash 12.00% (95% CI 3.00-38.00%), PR 4% (95% CI 2.00-8.00%) and KA 6.00% (95% CI 5.00-7.00%). CONCLUSION: The most frequent dermatological toxicities associated with vemurafenib treatment in patients with melanoma were cSCC, rash, PR and KA. These data may be useful for estimation of the efficacy and safety of the drug during clinical treatment and for reducing the prevalence of adverse reactions to vemurafenib treatment in patients with melanoma.

29516526	Iron	Occupational Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Pleural abnormalities and exposure to elongate mineral particles in Minnesota iron ore (taconite) workers.	BACKGROUND: Iron ore (taconite) mining and processing are an important industry in northern Minnesota and western Michigan. Concerns around exposures have centered largely on exposure to non-asbestiform amphibole elongate mineral particles (EMPs) found in the eastern portion of the Minnesota iron range. METHODS: A cross sectional survey was undertaken of current and former taconite workers and spouses along with a detailed exposure assessment. Participants provided an occupational history and had a chest radiograph performed. RESULTS: A total of 1188 workers participated. Potential exposures to non-amphibole EMPs were evident across multiple jobs in all active mines. Pleural abnormalities were found in 16.8% of workers. There was an association of pleural abnormalities with cumulative EMP exposure that was not specific to the eastern portion of the range. CONCLUSION: There was evidence of a mild to moderate increase in pleural abnormalities in this population of miners, associated with geographically non-specific cumulative EMP exposure.

From the Bladder Cancer Prognosis Programme 575 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) cases, 139 muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) cases and 130 BC-free controls with retrospective data on smoking behaviour and cigarette brand were identified. Independently measured TNCO yields of cigarettes sold in the UK were obtained through the UK Department of Health and merged with the Bladder Cancer Prognosis Programme dataset to estimate the daily intake of TNCO. BC risk increased by TNCO intake category for NMIBC cases (P <0.050 in all multivariate models), but only for the daily intake of tar for MIBC cases (P=0.046) in multivariate models. No difference in risk was observed between smokers of low-tar/low-nicotine and high-tar/high-nicotine cigarettes compared with never smokers, either for NMIBC (P=0.544) or MIBC (P=0.449). High daily intake of TNCO additionally increases the risk of both NMIBC and MIBC compared with low daily intake. However, as there is no difference in BC risk between low-tar/low-nicotine and high-tar/high-nicotine cigarette smokers, it remains unclear whether smoking behaviour or TNCO yield of cigarettes explains this association.

"Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, often referred to as ""chemobrain,"" is a common side effect. In this study, mice received three intraperitoneal injections of a combination of docetaxel, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide (DAC) at 2-day intervals. A water maze test was used to examine cognitive performance, and manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) was used to examine hippocampal neuronal activity. The whole brain, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and blood samples were then collected for cytokine measurement. The DAC-treated mice displayed a significantly shorter duration spent in and fewer entries into the target quadrant of the water maze than the control mice and a pronounced decrease in MEMRI signal intensity in the hippocampal subregions. In a separate experiment using in vivo transcranial two-photon imaging, DAC markedly eliminated dendritic spines without changing the rate of spine formation, leading to a striking loss of spines in the medial prefrontal cortex. DAC treatment resulted in significant elevations in the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and in significant decreases in the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in most of the sera and brain tissues examined. The IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels of several sera and brain tissues showed strong inverse correlations with the duration and number of entries in the target quadrant of the water maze and with the hippocampal MEMRI signal intensity, but also showed striking positive correlations with spine elimination and loss. These results indicate that chemobrain is associated with cytokine dysregulation and disrupted neuroplasticity of the brain."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1) have recently revolutionized anti-cancer therapy and are nowadays used in different metastatic cancers. These treatments may induce immune-related adverse events which frequently involve the digestive tract and, to a less extent the liver. The tissular injuries, which are still poorly characterized from a morphological and physiopathological point of view, may lead on one side to the interruption of a life-saving treatment and on the other side to the development of severe complications, if not death. Therefore, it is crucial to diagnose as early as possible and treat these digestive and hepatic adverse effects in an optimal way. This article aims to describe the clinical and pathological presentations of digestive and hepatic adverse events induced by these immunotherapies.

28416782	Carbamazepine	Intracranial Arteriosclerosis	0	1	0	0		Assessment of atherosclerotic risk among patients with epilepsy on valproic acid, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine treatment.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term effects of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid (VPA), and lamotrigine (LTG) as monotherapy on the markers of vascular risk. METHODS: The present cross-sectional study was carried out at the Department of Neurology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), Karachi, Pakistan, from 2012 to 2013. We selected 120 adult patients with epilepsy and 40 control subjects. The patients with epilepsy were divided into 3 groups according to the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (CBZ, n = 40; VPA, n = 40; and LTG, n = 40). All participants; total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), ratio of TC/HDL-c, ratio of LDL-c/HDL-c, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure was determined. RESULTS: In patients with epilepsy, CBZ and VPA treatment caused a noteworthy increase in the concentrations of TG, TC, and LDL-c compared with LTG treatment and the control group (p<0.001). The HDL-c significantly decreased in CBZ, VPA, and LTG-treated patients as compared with controls (p<0.001). The ratio of LDL-c/HDL-c and TC/HDL-c significantly increased in VPA- and CBZ-treated groups compared with the LTG-treated, and control group, while the ratio was also considerably elevated in patients treated with CBZ as compared with the patients treated with VPA. The weight and BMI of the patients treated with AEDs were higher (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with epilepsy on CBZ or VPA have changed vascular risk markers that may lead to atherosclerosis, while LTG-treated patients have less alteration in lipid profile.

31142711	Nivolumab	Myositis	1	1	0	0	0.0	[An autopsy case of nivolumab-induced myasthenia gravis and myositis].	An 84-year-old woman developed blepharoptosis, diplopia, weakness of extremities, and dysphagia with elevation of serum CK levels after treatment with nivolumab against renal cell carcinoma. 3 Hz repetitive stimulation showed waning in the trapezius muscle, leading to the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Laboratory examination showed that anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody was negative. We performed IVIg and steroid therapy. However, her symptoms did not improve, and she died of respiratory failure, although serum CK levels ameliorated to the normal range. The results of autopsy showed atrophy of muscle fibers and massive infiltration of inflammatory cells in the endomysium of the iliopsoas muscle and diaphragm, indicating occurrence of myositis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CD8-positive T cells mainly infiltrates in the endomysium with a small number of CD4-potive T cells. Here, we report an autopsy case of nivolumab-induced myasthenia gravis and myositis.

31081301	Clopidogrel	Hemorrhage	0	0	0	0		Under-prescription of novel antiplatelet drugs in patients with acute coronary syndrome and previous cardiovascular disease.	"BACKGROUND: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) (stroke, peripheral arterial disease [PAD] or coronary artery disease [CAD]) are at high risk of serious events and mortality. Current clinical guidelines recommend new antiplatelet drugs (NADs) for high cardiovascular risk patients with ACS; however, these drugs are underused in different scenarios. METHODS: This study included 1717 ACS patients from 3 tertiary hospitals. Of them, 641 (37.33%) suffered from previous CVD: 149 patients with stroke, 154 patients with PAD and 541 patients with CAD. Bleeding, mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 year of follow-up after hospital discharge were analyzed. RESULTS: NADs administration during hospital stay and at discharge was less frequent in patients with previous CVDs (P<0.001, for both). Cox analysis in this cohort of patients showed that clopidogrel prescription at discharge was independently associated with MACEs (HR: 1.59 [95% CI: 1.03-2.45]; P=0.036) and with death (HR: 1.99 [95% CI: 1.00-3.98]; P=0.049) in multivariate analysis. More specifically, when ticagrelor prescription at discharge was compared with clopidogrel, a significant death reduction was found in both, the univariate and the multivariate Cox analysis (HR: 4.54 [95% CI: 2.26-9.13]; P<0.001 and HR: 2.61 [95% CI: 1.16-5.90]; P=0.021, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: New antiplatelet drugs, especially ticagrelor, showed lower rates of mortality in patients with CVD without differences for bleeding. Despite the recommendations of current clinical guidelines for high risk patients with ACS, the use of NADs is very low in ""real-life"" patients with previous CVD."

30350178	Trastuzumab	Diarrhea	0	0	0	0		Phase I trial of afatinib and 3-weekly trastuzumab with optimal anti-diarrheal management in patients with HER2-positive metastatic cancer.	BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab is the mainstay of therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer but resistance frequently occurs. Afatinib, an irreversible oral ErbB family blocker, shows clinical activity in trastuzumab-refractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This phase I study used a modified 3 + 3 dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral once-daily afatinib in combination with 3-weekly intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg week 1; 6 mg/kg 3-weekly thereafter) for patients with confirmed advanced or metastatic HER2-positive cancer. RESULTS: Of the 13 patients treated, 6 received daily afatinib 20 mg and 7 received 30 mg. One patient who received afatinib 30 mg developed a tumor lysis syndrome and was not evaluable for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Two of the six remaining patients receiving afatinib 30 mg and 1 of the 6 patients receiving afatinib 20 mg experienced DLTs (all CTCAE >/= grade 2 diarrhea despite optimal management) in the first treatment cycle. The most common drug-related adverse events were diarrhea (n = 13, 100%), asthenia (n = 8, 61.5%), rash (n = 7, 53.8%) and paronychia (n = 5, 38.5%). No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed. One patient (7.7%) had an objective response (20 mg afatinib cohort). Nine patients (69.2%) experienced clinical benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Despite optimal management of diarrhea including treatment of grade I symptoms, it was not possible to treat the patients above a dose of 20 mg of afatinib daily in combination with 3-weekly trastuzumab. The MTD of afatinib in combination with the recommended 3-weekly dose of trastuzumab was 20 mg daily.
30350190	Irinotecan	Diarrhea	0	1	0	0		Amitriptyline prevents CPT-11-induced early-onset diarrhea and colonic apoptosis without reducing overall gastrointestinal damage in a rat model of mucositis.	PURPOSE: Gastrointestinal mucositis (GIM) is one of the most debilitating side effects of the chemotherapy agent, irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11). The toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway is a key mediator implicated in the pathophysiology underlying GIM. The tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline has been shown to inhibit TLR2 and TLR4 activity in in vitro models. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of amitriptyline on the development of GIM following CPT-11. METHODS: Male albino Wistar rats were treated with either CPT-11 (125 mg/kg, i.p., n = 18), amitriptyline (20 mg/kg, n = 18), both agents (n = 18), or vehicle control (n = 18) and killed at 6, 48, or 96 h. Differences between groups in measurements of gastrointestinal toxicity (diarrhea and weight loss), mucosal injury (apoptosis and histopathology score), colonic expression of TLRs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were determined. RESULTS: CPT-11-induced diarrhea and colonic apoptosis were inhibited by amitriptyline at 6 h. However, rats were not protected from weight loss or mucosal injury over the time course of CPT-11-induced GIM. Interleukin-1 beta transcript expression was significantly decreased with amitriptyline treatment at 6 h, although protein expression did not differ between groups. There was no change in TLR4 or TLR2 expression in any group. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic amitriptyline was able to inhibit early intestinal damage in this rat model of CPT-11-induced GIM, but exacerbated late-onset injury. These findings do not support use of amitriptyline as an approach for mitigation of GIM in this setting.

We report the case of a 42-year-old female patient who developed peculiar skin lesions due to subcutaneous polyethylene glycol (PEG) interferon beta-1a. The dermatological examination showed hypochromic macules that had coalesced into a 10-cm-diameter patch. On the abdomen injection sites, there was a greyish diffuse hyperpigmentation arranged irregularly in annular macules. Fungal infection, vitiligo and pityriasis alba were excluded. After 6 months, the lesions had worsened. This is the first case of localized pigmentation disorder reported with interferon beta, and while the clinical findings are not ascribable to vitiligo or interferon-related facial/mucosal hyperpigmentation, they may partially share the underlining mechanisms.
30968726	Alemtuzumab	Autoimmune Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Autoimmune thyroid disease following treatment with alemtuzumab for multiple sclerosis.	Alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, is effective in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Common adverse effects include the development of autoimmune diseases, and Graves' disease is one of the most frequent presentations. We report here a case of alemtuzumab-induced thyroid disease in a female patient who showed a phase of thyrotoxicosis with positive anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, but a negative TSH receptor antibody, spontaneously followed by hypothyroidism. The aim is to illustrate the clinical presentation, evaluation over time, and the possibility to consider a conservative management up to the spontaneous resolution of the thyrotoxicosis. All these are intended to emphasize the importance of pretreatment screening and follow-up in the management of treatment with alemtuzumab.
29895599	Heparin	Hemorrhage	0	0	0	0		Activated Clotting Time to Guide Heparin Dosing in Non-ST-Segment-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Treated With IIb/IIIa Inhibitors: Impact on Ischemic and Bleeding Outcomes: Insights From the TAO Trial.	BACKGROUND: Monitoring anticoagulation with activated clotting time (ACT) has been proposed to reduce ischemic or bleeding events. However, the value of using ACT to improve outcomes is uncertain. This study sought to determine the relationship between ACT and outcomes during percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) treated by unfractionated heparin with GPIs (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors). METHODS AND RESULTS: From the randomized TAO trial (Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndromes With Otamixaban), we analyzed the value of ACT to predict ischemic and bleeding outcomes in the 3275 patients receiving unfractionated heparin plus eptifibatide. Ischemic and safety outcomes were analyzed according to ACT to determine the best threshold. Median peak ACT was 225 s. There was no correlation (r=-0.02; P=0.24) between the unfractionated heparin dose received and the ACT value before percutaneous coronary intervention. There was no evidence of a nonlinear association between ACT and either ischemic or bleeding events (P=0.66; P=0.07). No threshold was found to predict ischemic complications. Conversely, increased bleeding was observed with ACT >230 s with an optimal threshold of ACTs >/=250 s (4.53% versus 6.17%; odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.06; P=0.028). This optimal threshold varied according to access site: >/=250 s (6.86% versus 10.18%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.45; P=0.047) by femoral approach and >/=290 s (2.86% versus 5.43%; odds ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-4.44; P=0.027) by radial approach. CONCLUSIONS: In the TAO trial, peak procedural ACT >/=250 s was associated with increased bleeding risk in non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome patients treated with unfractionated heparin plus GPIs. This threshold was increased to 290 s when performing radial approach. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01076764.

30167998	Dabigatran	Hemorrhage	0	1	0	0		Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in Patients with Renal Failure.	A recent survey on the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) revealed that 43% of patients with atrial fibrillation and renal impairment were potentially overdosed and had a hazard ratio for major bleeding of 2.19. In this review, we analyse and discuss the effect of renal failure on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of DOACs and of strategies proposed to adjust doses according to the level of renal dysfunction. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of available DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban) differ substantially as regards oral bioavailability, plasma protein binding and the relative involvement of renal and non-renal elimination. In this respect, 80% of dabigatran is excreted as an unchanged drug in urine, whereas edoxaban, rivaroxaban, apixaban and betrixiban are excreted unchanged by, respectively, 50, 33, 27 and 11% of the dose. Therefore, drug exposure (the area under the concentration-time curve, AUC) is expected to increase to differing extents, depending on the residual renal function and the contribution of the kidneys to the excretion of each drug. Our analysis found that the increased AUC in patients with severe renal dysfunction was greater than expected in the case of dabigatran, betrixaban and rivaroxaban, indicating that other pharmacokinetic parameters may be altered besides renal clearance. Although DAOC pharmacodynamics do not seem to be altered by renal diseases (the correlation between plasma levels and anticoagulant effects overlaps that of healthy subjects), renal failure per se is associated with an increased risk of bleeding and thromboembolism. Guidelines on dose adjustments in patients with renal dysfunction have been published by three National Drug Agencies (FDA, EMA, HC), but many of their items do not match one another, reflecting our substantial paucity of knowledge in advanced renal failure. Routine monitoring of DOAC anticoagulant effects or plasma concentrations is not recommended, since no validated therapeutic ranges have been established. However, this approach may be useful in emergency situations such as bleeding or thrombotic events, urgent surgery, pharmacokinetic interactions, etc. We conclude that more experimental work is needed to improve our knowledge of DOAC pharmacology in renal failure and to provide clinicians with valid tools to adjust therapy.

30772164	Tissue Plasminogen Activator	Tongue Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Hemilingual Angioedema after Thrombolysis in a Patient on an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker.	Orolingual angioedema (OLAE) is a rare adverse effect of alteplase. Previous studies have associated the occurrence of OLAE with thrombolysed patients maintained on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. We report a case of a 60-year-old male presenting with hyperacute ischemic stroke developing hemilingual edema after thrombolysis. He was previously maintained on an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), losartan. The swelling resolved over 2 days with immediate administration of intravenous steroids and antihistamine drugs. Our case is the third documented case of OLAE occurring in a thrombolysed patient concurrently taking an ARB. The presence of hemilingual edema in a post-thrombolysis patient maintained on losartan suggests a possible association between OLAE and ARBs.
30847961	Lamivudine	Mitochondrial Myopathies	1	1	0	0	0.0	Toxic myopathy with multiple deletions in mitochondrial DNA associated with long-term use of oral anti-viral drugs for hepatitis B: A case study.	Oral nucleoside analogs (NAs) reduce hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication by inhibiting HBV DNA polymerase. However, NAs can also affect human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase, which can lead to mtDNA depletion (quantitative abnormality). Indeed, several mitochondrial myopathy cases have been reported in which a reduced mtDNA copy number was induced by oral NAs for hepatitis B. Herein, we report a case of toxic myopathy with multiple mtDNA deletions (qualitative abnormality) associated with long-term use of NAs for hepatitis B. A 68-year-old woman, who underwent long-term treatment with lamivudine and adefovir for chronic hepatitis B, developed proximal muscle weakness in the four extremities. Neurological examination showed mild proximal muscle weakness and atrophy in the four extremities. Upon admission to our hospital, her blood lactate/pyruvate ratio during an aerobic exercise test was elevated. Myogenic patterns were observed in lower limb muscles on electromyographic examination. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse atrophy of proximal muscles in the four extremities with no signal changes. A biopsy from the biceps brachii muscle showed an abnormally large variation in fiber size, scattered muscle fibers with decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity, and ragged-red fibers. Analysis of mtDNA from skeletal muscle revealed no decrease in copy number but increased incidence of multiple deletions, including a deletion of 4977 base pairs (known as the common deletion) reflecting oxidative stress-induced mtDNA damage. This case study indicates that long-term oral antiviral therapy for hepatitis B can induce chronic oxidative damage to mtDNA resulting in qualitative mtDNA abnormalities and toxic myopathy.
30381018	Aluminum	Granuloma	0	0	0	0		Granulomas Following Subcutaneous Injection With Aluminum Adjuvant-Containing Products in Sheep.	The use of vaccines including aluminum (Al)-based adjuvants is widespread among small ruminants and other animals. They are associated with the appearance of transient injection site nodules corresponding to granulomas. This study aims to characterize the morphology of these granulomas, to understand the role of the Al adjuvant in their genesis, and to establish the presence of the metal in regional lymph nodes. A total of 84 male neutered lambs were selected and divided into 3 treatment groups of 28 animals each: (1) vaccine (containing Al-based adjuvant), (2) adjuvant-only, and (3) control. A total of 19 subcutaneous injections were performed in a time frame of 15 months. Granulomas and regional lymph nodes were evaluated by clinicopathological means. All of the vaccine and 92.3% of the adjuvant-only lambs presented injection-site granulomas; the granulomas were more numerous in the group administered the vaccine. Bacterial culture in granulomas was always negative. Histologically, granulomas in the vaccine group presented a higher degree of severity. Al was specifically identified by lumogallion staining in granulomas and lymph nodes. Al median content was significantly higher ( P < .001) in the lymph nodes of the vaccine group (82.65 mug/g) compared with both adjuvant-only (2.53 mug/g) and control groups (0.96 mug/g). Scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrated aggregates of Al within macrophages in vaccine and adjuvant-only groups. In these two groups, Al-based adjuvants induce persistent, sterile, subcutaneous granulomas with macrophage-driven translocation of Al to regional lymph nodes. Local translocation of Al may induce further accumulation in distant tissues and be related to the appearance of systemic signs.
29656050	Bortezomib	Diarrhea	0	0	0	0		An Expanded Treatment Protocol of Panobinostat Plus Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in Patients With Previously Treated Myeloma.	BACKGROUND: Panobinostat was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Commission in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone for patients with multiple myeloma who have received >/= 2 regimens, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug. The PANEX (panobinostat expansion) treatment protocol provided access to panobinostat and gathered additional safety data before commercial availability. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In treatment phase 1, patients received panobinostat 20 mg 3 times per week plus bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) twice weekly with dexamethasone 20 mg on the days of and after bortezomib treatment. Patients with no change or better in treatment phase 1 proceeded to treatment phase 2, when bortezomib was reduced to once weekly. Unlike in the phase III trial, PANORAMA-1 (panobinostat or placebo with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma), bortezomib could be administered either subcutaneously or intravenously. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with a median number of previous treatments of 4 (range, 1-12) were enrolled; most received subcutaneous bortezomib (87%). The overall response rate (partial response or better) was 56%. Grade 3/4 adverse events included thrombocytopenia (47%), fatigue (31%), dehydration (26%), and diarrhea (18%). Among the patients who received subcutaneous bortezomib, relatively low rates of peripheral neuropathy (all grade, 15%) and notable grade 3/4 adverse events (thrombocytopenia, 47%; diarrhea, 12%) were observed. CONCLUSION: Overall, data from the PANEX trial support regulatory approval of panobinostat plus bortezomib and dexamethasone and suggest the potential tolerability benefits of subcutaneous bortezomib in this regimen.

BACKGROUND: Although ticagrelor has improved clinical outcomes among patients with acute coronary syndrome compared with clopidogrel, adherence to this new antiplatelet agent in real-world practice has not been fully investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between November 2011 and June 2014, 1278 of 4831 consecutive patients (26.5%) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at a tertiary care center were treated with ticagrelor. Premature ticagrelor cessation was categorized into (1) change, when ticagrelor was replaced by prasugrel; (2) de-escalation, when ticagrelor was replaced by clopidogrel; and (3) premature discontinuation, when ticagrelor was discontinued without P2Y12 inhibitor replacement. Of 1278 patients treated with ticagrelor, premature treatment cessation occurred in 212 patients (17%). De-escalation to clopidogrel was the most frequent scenario (57%; n=120), followed by premature discontinuation (28%; n=60) and change to prasugrel (15%; n=32). Reasons for ticagrelor cessation included adverse effects (49%), initiation of oral anticoagulation (19%), and unspecified general practitioner preference (10%). Most frequent adverse effects leading to premature ticagrelor cessation were bleeding (41%), dyspnea (29%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%). Premature ticagrelor cessation was not associated with an increased risk of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.40-1.32; P=0.29). CONCLUSIONS: Premature ticagrelor cessation in routine clinical practice occurred in 1 of 6 patients and was primarily related to adverse effects among which bleeding and dyspnea were the most frequent. Although premature ticagrelor cessation was not associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, this finding requires careful interpretation in view of the modest sample size.

BACKGROUND: Although ticagrelor has improved clinical outcomes among patients with acute coronary syndrome compared with clopidogrel, adherence to this new antiplatelet agent in real-world practice has not been fully investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between November 2011 and June 2014, 1278 of 4831 consecutive patients (26.5%) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at a tertiary care center were treated with ticagrelor. Premature ticagrelor cessation was categorized into (1) change, when ticagrelor was replaced by prasugrel; (2) de-escalation, when ticagrelor was replaced by clopidogrel; and (3) premature discontinuation, when ticagrelor was discontinued without P2Y12 inhibitor replacement. Of 1278 patients treated with ticagrelor, premature treatment cessation occurred in 212 patients (17%). De-escalation to clopidogrel was the most frequent scenario (57%; n=120), followed by premature discontinuation (28%; n=60) and change to prasugrel (15%; n=32). Reasons for ticagrelor cessation included adverse effects (49%), initiation of oral anticoagulation (19%), and unspecified general practitioner preference (10%). Most frequent adverse effects leading to premature ticagrelor cessation were bleeding (41%), dyspnea (29%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%). Premature ticagrelor cessation was not associated with an increased risk of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.40-1.32; P=0.29). CONCLUSIONS: Premature ticagrelor cessation in routine clinical practice occurred in 1 of 6 patients and was primarily related to adverse effects among which bleeding and dyspnea were the most frequent. Although premature ticagrelor cessation was not associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, this finding requires careful interpretation in view of the modest sample size.

31054846	Aspirin	Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage	0	0	0	0		Pantoprazole to Prevent Gastroduodenal Events in Patients Receiving Rivaroxaban and/or Aspirin in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND & AIMS: Antiplatelets and anticoagulants are associated with increased upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We evaluated whether proton pump inhibitor therapy could reduce this risk. METHODS: We performed a 3 x 2 partial factorial double-blind trial of 17,598 participants with stable cardiovascular disease and peripheral artery disease. Participants were randomly assigned to groups given pantoprazole 40 mg daily or placebo, as well as rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with aspirin 100 mg once daily, rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily, or aspirin 100 mg alone. The primary outcome was time to first upper gastrointestinal event, defined as a composite of overt bleeding, upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a gastroduodenal lesion or of unknown origin, occult bleeding, symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcer or >/=5 erosions, upper gastrointestinal obstruction, or perforation. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in upper gastrointestinal events between the pantoprazole group (102 of 8791 events) and the placebo group (116 of 8807 events) (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-1.15). Pantoprazole significantly reduced bleeding of gastroduodenal lesions (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.94; P = .03); this reduction was greater when we used a post-hoc definition of bleeding gastroduodenal lesion (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.74), although the number needed to treat still was high (n = 982; 95% confidence interval, 609-2528). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, we found that routine use of proton pump inhibitors in patients receiving low-dose anticoagulation and/or aspirin for stable cardiovascular disease does not reduce upper gastrointestinal events, but may reduce bleeding from gastroduodenal lesions.

30868494	Methylprednisolone	Femur Head Necrosis	0	1	0	0		Decrease of GSK3beta Ser-9 Phosphorylation Induced Osteoblast Apoptosis in Rat Osteoarthritis Model.	Nowadays, the cumulative intake of glucocorticoids has become the most common pathogenic factor for non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Apoptosis of osteoblasts is considered as the main reason of ONFH at the molecular level. Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) is an important regulator of cellular differentiation and apoptosis pathway, which can modulate the balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Several studies have reported about its function in osteoporosis, but little is known about it in osteonecrosis. In our study, lipopolysaccharide and methylprednisolone were utilized to establish a rat ONFH model. The phosphorylation of GSK3beta Ser-9 was decreased in the model. Western blotting examination of beta-catenin, Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 revealed that the osteoblasts were apoptotic. In dexamethasone (Dex)-incubated primary osteoblasts, the expression profile of GSK3beta phosphorylation and apoptotic factors were consistent with those in the rat ONFH model. To further investigate the regulation of osteonecrosis caused by GSK3beta, the expression and function of GSK3beta were inhibited in Dex-incubated primary osteoblasts. The knockdown of GSK3beta by siRNA decreased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, but increased Bcl-2 and beta-catenin. On the other hand, selective inhibition of GSK3beta function by LiCl counteracted the activation of caspase-3 induced by Dex. Our work is the first study about the GSK3beta phosphorylation in ONFH, and provides evidence for further therapeutic methods.

30522387	Cefuroxime	Anaphylaxis	1	1	0	1	1.0	Cefuroxime-induced anaphylaxis with prominent central nervous system manifestations: A case report.	Cefuroxime is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that causes immediate hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild urticaria to severe anaphylactic shock. Anaphylactic reactions typically involve multiple systems, most notably, the skin and the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Here, we report the unusual case of a patient who presented with oral cefuroxime-induced anaphylaxis with prominent neurologic manifestations. To identify the drug responsible for the anaphylaxis, we performed skin tests. Based on positive skin-prick test results, the diagnosis of cefuroxime-induced anaphylaxis was confirmed. Therefore, we suggest that clinicians should consider the possibility of a drug-induced anaphylactic reaction when neurologic but not cutaneous symptoms are present. The skin-prick test is a safe and useful diagnostic tool to confirm this kind of immediate drug hypersensitivity.
30182426	Bupivacaine	Cartilage Diseases	0	0	0	0		Plasma and synovial fluid concentrations and cartilage toxicity of bupivacaine following intra-articular administration of a liposomal formulation to horses.	BACKGROUND: The use of intra-articular (IA) local anaesthetics has proven to be an effective means to treat post-operative pain. The effects of local anaesthetics on equine chondrocytes are mixed with some studies reporting chondrodestruction and others no adverse effects. A liposomal formulation of bupivacaine is used in people and dogs by intra- and peri-articular administration to provide up to 72 h of analgesia. The potential uses, side effects including chondrotoxicity, and likelihood of abuse (long-term analgesic effects) has not been evaluated in horses. OBJECTIVES: Describe bupivacaine concentrations following IA administration and assess biomarkers as indicators of the effects of liposomal bupivacaine on chondrocytes in vivo. STUDY DESIGN: Parallel design. METHODS: Sixteen exercised horses received a single IA administration of 0.12 mg/kg liposomal bupivacaine or 0.9% saline. Blood and urine samples were collected for 96 h post-drug administration. Six horses treated with bupivacaine and those receiving saline, underwent daily arthrocentesis. Six additional bupivacaine treated horses underwent arthrocentesis at 96 h. Drug concentrations were measured using LC-MS/MS and pharmacokinetic analyses performed. Immunoassays were used to measure markers of collagen degradation (C2C, C12C) and cartilage matrix synthesis (CPII, CS846) in synovial fluid. RESULTS: The bupivacaine plasma elimination half-life was 17.8 +/- 5.42 and 11.9 +/- 5.17 h for horses from which synovial fluid was collected daily and at 96 h respectively. Bupivacaine concentrations in the joint were still detectable at 96 h. Significant increases in C12C and C2C were noted at 96 h in horses undergoing arthrocentesis at 96 h only. CPII was increased at 48 h and CS846 at 24 and 48 h in horses sampled daily. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Limited number of animals and absence of liposome control group. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained concentrations of IA bupivacaine suggest viability of this medication as an intra-articular analgesic. Effects on equine chondrocytes need further study.

30948396	Methotrexate	Melanoma	1	0	0	0		Primary malignant melanoma of the urethra in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate.	We report a case of a 79-year-old woman with urinary incontinence who presented at a urogynaecology appointment. Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with methotrexate (MXT) for 22 years. A polypoidal lesion was protruding from the meatus urethrae. The histoimmunocytology confirmed a primary superficial spreading malignant melanoma. The tumour was extensively excised, but 8 months later, due to a lymphatic nodal swelling, a positron emission tomography/CT was performed showing a process suspicious of malignant melanoma and multiple distant metastasis. The subsequent treatment was palliative and 1 year later, the patient died. The aetiology of malignant melanomas in the urethra is poorly understood. There is consistent evidence that RA is associated with a number of cancers, but it remains controversial whether this risk is increased with MXT. This case emphasises the importance of gynaecological examination even in patients with only weak symptoms from the pelvic region, especially in patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment.
29570101	Cisplatin	Venous Thromboembolism	0	1	0	0		Venous thromboembolic events in patients with lung cancer treated with cisplatin-based versus carboplatin/nedaplatin-based chemotherapy.	An association between chemotherapy and venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) in patients with cancer is well established, with cisplatin (CDDP) being one of the most well-studied risk factors. However, whether CDDP is more strongly associated with occurrence of VTEs than carboplatin (CBDCA) or nedaplatin (CDGP) is controversial. Our purposes were to characterize patients with lung cancer and in-hospital VTEs, identify risk factors associated with VTEs, and compare the risks associated with CDDP-based versus CBDCA/CDGP-based chemotherapy. We retrospectively identified patients with lung cancer who underwent platinum-based chemotherapy from April 2012 to March 2015 from a national inpatient database in Japan. We used multivariable logistic regression analysis to analyze associations between various factors, including chemotherapy regimens and VTE. Of 235 104 eligible patients, 675 (0.29%) had VTEs after receiving platinum-based chemotherapy while hospitalized. Multivariable analysis showed that age, activity of daily living index, and invasive medical procedures were significant risk factors for the occurrence of VTE. Furthermore, CDDP-based chemotherapy was associated with a higher rate of VTE than CBDCA/CDGP-based chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio: 1.35; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.68; P<0.01). In conclusion, CDDP-based chemotherapy is a stronger risk factor for VTEs than CBDCA/CDGP-based chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer.
29867078	Ampicillin	Anxiety	1	1	0	0	0.0	Evidence for interplay among antibacterial-induced gut microbiota disturbance, neuro-inflammation, and anxiety in mice.	The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is the mechanistic connection between antibacterial-dependent gut microbiota disturbance and anxiety. First, exposure of mice to ampicillin caused anxiety and colitis and increased the population of Proteobacteria, particularly Klebsiella oxytoca, in gut microbiota and fecal and blood lipopolysaccharide levels, while decreasing lactobacilli population including Lactobacillus reuteri. Next, treatments with fecal microbiota of ampicillin-treated mouse (FAP), K. oxytoca, or lipopolysaccharide isolated from K. oxytoca (KL) induced anxiety and colitis in mice and increased blood corticosterone, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide levels. Moreover, these treatments also increased the recruitment of microglia (Iba1(+)), monocytes (CD11b(+)/CD45(+)), and dendritic cells (CD11b(+)/CD11c(+)) to the hippocampus, as well as the population of apoptotic neuron cells (caspase-3(+)/NeuN(+)) in the brain. Furthermore, ampicillin, K. oxytoca, and KL induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-1beta and TNF-alpha expression in the colon and brain as well as increased gut membrane permeability. Finally, oral administration of L. reuteri alleviated ampicillin-induced anxiety and colitis. These results suggest that ampicillin exposure can cause anxiety through neuro-inflammation which can be induced by monocyte/macrophage-activated gastrointestinal inflammation and elevated Proteobacteria population including K. oxytoca, while treatment with lactobacilli suppresses it.
30043209	Oxaliplatin	Peripheral Nervous System Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	The risk factors for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral sensory neuropathy and thrombocytopenia in advanced gastric cancer.	PURPOSE: Peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) and thrombocytopenia are the main dose-limiting toxicities of oxaliplatin for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer (AGC). Because the risk factors for those toxicities in practice have not been clarified, we conducted this prospective study. METHODS: AGC patients who received oxaliplatin-based therapy at any of seven institutions participating in the Kyushu Medical Oncology Group were assessed after we obtained written informed consent. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients including 39 males and 21 females were examined. The median age was 66 years. The numbers of patients receiving oxaliplatin as the first, second, or third and later lines of therapy were 39, 16, and 5, respectively. An initial dose of 130, 100, or < 100 mg/m(2) oxaliplatin was administered to 12, 39, and 9 patients, respectively. S-1 or capecitabine as a concomitant drug was administered in 54 and 6 patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the comorbidity of diabetes mellitus was associated with >/= grade 2 thrombocytopenia (p = 0.035). No significant risk factor was associated with >/= grade 2 PSN. However, the accumulated dose of oxaliplatin exhibited a strong correlation with >/= grade 2 PSN (p = 0.0043), and the predicted accumulated dose of oxaliplatin in which 10% of patients developed >/= grade 2 PSN was 800 mg/m(2). The frequency of PSN in subsequent paclitaxel therapy in patients with >/= grade 2 or worse PSN in oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy did not increase compared to those with none or grade 1 PSN in oxaliplatin. CONCLUSION: Thrombocytopenia in AGC patients with diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored during oxaliplatin-based therapy.
30100558	Aspirin	Hemorrhage	0	0	0	0		The safety of triple antiplatelet therapy under thromboelastography guidance in patients undergoing stenting for ischemic cerebrovascular disease.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety of triple antiplatelet therapy (TAT) with cilostazol in patients undergoing stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis. METHODS: A prospectively collected database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis and showed resistance to aspirin and/or clopidogrel as assessed by pre-stenting thromboelastography (TEG) testing. Patients were assigned to a TAT group and a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) group. Major complications were defined as thromboembolic events (transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke, and stent thrombosis) or major bleeding events within 30 days, and minor complications were defined as extracranial bleeding that did not require vascular surgery or transfusion within 30 days. RESULTS: A total of 183 patients were identified. The incidence of major complications was significantly lower in the TAT group than in the DAT group (TAT group vs. DAT group, 1/110 vs. 6/73; P=0.017). TIAs occurred in four patients, with one in the TAT group and three in the DAT group (1/110 vs. 3/73; P=0.303). Ischemic strokes occurred in three patients in the DAT group (TAT group vs. DAT group, P=0.062). No major bleeding events or stent thrombosis was recorded in either group. Two patients (one in each group) experienced minor complications that resolved without additional treatment (1/110 vs. 1/73; P>0.999). CONCLUSIONS: TAT under TEG guidance appears to be a safe antiplatelet strategy in patients undergoing stenting for extracranial and/or intracranial artery stenosis. By employing TAT under TEG guidance, favorable outcomes can be achieved in these patients.

30413905	Rifamycins	Fibrosis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Locally Used Antibiotics for Spinal Infection Prophylaxis and Their Effects on Epidural Fibrosis: an Experimental Laminectomy Study in Rats Using Rifamycin and Gentamycin.	The study aims to assess the effects of antibiotics (ABs), which are typically used in spinal infection prophylaxis, on the formation of epidural fibrosis (EF). Specifically, we investigated the effect of rifamycin and gentamycin on EF formation in laminectomized rats. Thirty-two rats were randomly and equally divided into four groups as follows: laminectomy and physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (control); laminectomy and rifamycin; laminectomy and gentamicin; and laminectomy and a mixture of rifamycin and gentamicin. Laminectomy was performed on L1 and L2 vertebrae in all rats. One month after spinal surgery, spinal tissue samples surrounding the laminectomy were cut with a microtome and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome. The histopathological analysis included examining the extent of EF, fibroblast cell density, and cartilage and bone regeneration. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 program (SPSS IBM, Turkey). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. EF value differences between the AB treatment groups and the control group were statistically significant (p = 0.030). Specifically, binary comparisons indicated that the EF value was significantly higher in the rifamycin group than that in the control group (p = 0.003; p < 0.05). Our study suggests that locally applied ABs, especially rifamycin, should be diluted before administration to the epidural space.
30536809	Oxaliplatin	Peripheral Nervous System Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Incidence, severity, longitudinal trends and predictors of acute and chronic oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in Taiwanese patients with colorectal cancer.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal incidence, severity, pattern of changes or predictors of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXAIPN) in Taiwanese patients with colorectal cancer. A longitudinal repeated measures study design was employed, and 77 participants were recruited from the colorectal and oncology departments of two teaching medical centres in Taiwan. Physical examinations were performed, and self-reports regarding adverse impacts of OXAIPN and quality of life were obtained at five time points throughout 12 cycles of chemotherapy (C/T). The incidence of OXAIPN increased with C/T cycles (31.1%-81.9%), and the upper limb numbness and cold sensitivity were most significant acute OXAIPN symptoms (29.9%-73.6%). Findings also documented significant increases in overall severity, symptom distress, interference and physical results associated with OXAIPN over the course of C/T. Predictors of OXAIPN severity varied by treatment cycle, including younger patient, higher cumulative dose of oxaliplatin, greater body surface area, receipt of chemotherapy in winter and the occurrence of OXAIPN during prior C/T cycles. The results from this study might help healthcare providers to recognise the symptom characteristics, degree of influences, trends and high-risk group of OXAIPN, facilitating early evaluation and potential interventions to mitigate or prevent negative effects of OXAIPN on patients.
30927977	Hydroxyurea	Cell Transformation, Neoplastic	1	0	0	0		Therapy-associated leukemic transformation in myeloproliferative neoplasms - What do we know?	Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of progressive diseases that share a common pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory features, as well as a spontaneous risk of secondary AML. Certain MPN therapies have been associated with an increased risk of leukemic conversion, with robust data highlighting the highest rates with (32)P, chlorambucil, and pipobroman. Herein, we review risk factors for leukemic transformation, including therapy-related MPN-BP, with a focus on the debate surrounding the potential leukemogenicity of hydroxyurea. Lastly, we discuss emerging studies on the association between ruxolitinib and high grade B-cell lymphomas. We conclude that statistical associations have not implicated hydroxyurea monotherapy as leukemogenic. However, it is difficult to definitely disprove an association, as large prospective, controlled studies with decades of follow-up would be needed to draw conclusions. Overall, the concept of therapy-related neoplasms remains important to the field, and mandates judicious selection and sequencing of therapies for MPN patients.

31005813	Uric Acid	Arthritis, Gouty	0	0	0	0		Protective effects of Rhizoma smilacis glabrae extracts on potassium oxonate- and monosodium urate-induced hyperuricemia and gout in mice.	BACKGROUND: Rhizoma smilacis glabrae (RSG, tufuling) has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for deoxidation, dampness relief, and easing joint movement. The chemical composition of RSG has been systematically confirmed, and some of its compounds have been revealed to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, hypouricemic, and hepatoprotective effects. PURPOSE: We aimed to clarify whether a RSG extract attenuates hyperuricemia, paw edema, and renal injury in mice with potassium oxonate (PO)- and monosodium urate (MSU)-induced chronic hyperuricemia and gout. METHODS: RSG water extract was obtained and analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS. To establish a murine model with chronic hyperuricemia and gout, PO was orally administered daily from day 0 to day 24, whereas MSU was injected into the tibiotarsal joint on day 21. The mice in the drug intervention groups were treated once daily with doses of allopurinol or RSG extract from day 21 to day 24. The diameter of the ankle joints was measured with calipers. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-1beta concentrations, hepatic XOD activity, and uric acid, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were also determined. The right kidney and articular cavities were fixed, cut into sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RESULTS: Nine compounds in the RSG water extract were unambiguously identified as 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid, neoastilbin, astilbin, taxifolin, neoisoastilbin, isoastilbin, engeletin, isoengeletin, and trans-resveratrol. The RSGE treatment dose-dependently reduced PO- and MSU-induced paw edema, serum TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, uric acid, and BUN, while significantly elevated serum IL-10, urinary uric acid and creatinine levels as compared with the respective values in the hyperuricemic and gouty mice group (vehicle group). Moreover, the hepatic XOD activity was dose-dependently reduced by the RSGE treatment. In addition, RSGE treatment not only ameliorated the infiltration of inflammatory cells, tubular dilation and vacuole formation in renal tubular, but also improved the synovial hyperplasia, reduced inflammatory cells infiltration into the synovium, and diminished the erosive damage in the cartilage. CONCLUSION: The murine model with chronic hyperuricemia and gout be built in present study is consistent with the clinical symptoms of patients with long-standing hyperuricemia and acute gouty arthritis. RSG water extract has potent efficacy in ameliorating murine hyperuricemia and gout induced by PO and MSU.
31005813	Uric Acid	Gout	0	0	0	0		Protective effects of Rhizoma smilacis glabrae extracts on potassium oxonate- and monosodium urate-induced hyperuricemia and gout in mice.	BACKGROUND: Rhizoma smilacis glabrae (RSG, tufuling) has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for deoxidation, dampness relief, and easing joint movement. The chemical composition of RSG has been systematically confirmed, and some of its compounds have been revealed to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, hypouricemic, and hepatoprotective effects. PURPOSE: We aimed to clarify whether a RSG extract attenuates hyperuricemia, paw edema, and renal injury in mice with potassium oxonate (PO)- and monosodium urate (MSU)-induced chronic hyperuricemia and gout. METHODS: RSG water extract was obtained and analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS. To establish a murine model with chronic hyperuricemia and gout, PO was orally administered daily from day 0 to day 24, whereas MSU was injected into the tibiotarsal joint on day 21. The mice in the drug intervention groups were treated once daily with doses of allopurinol or RSG extract from day 21 to day 24. The diameter of the ankle joints was measured with calipers. Serum TNF-alpha and IL-1beta concentrations, hepatic XOD activity, and uric acid, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were also determined.

Herein synchronous occurrence of Hodgkin lymphoma and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome in a 60 year old male patient with small cell lung cancer treated with combined chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy is presented. The objective of this report is to stress the importance of documenting and monitoring adverse drug reactions that arise from chemotherapy. After four years of treatment with the combined chemotherapy, the patient presented inguinal lymphadenopathy and enlarged lymph nodes and histopathology rapport was suggestive for plasmacytoid variant of Castleman disease. Three years later, biopsy of lymph node was performed and diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma - mixed cellularity has been established. Molecular analyses revealed presence of dominant monoclonal population of the immunoglobulin genes in the oligo/monoclonal background. Bone marrow biopsy findings suggested secondary myelodysplasia and revealed signs of hematopoietic cells dismaturation with signs of megaloblastic maturation of the erytropoetic lineage, appearance of ALIP (abnormal localization of immature precursors) in the myeloid lineage and dysplastic megakaryocytes. In addition, an increased level of polyclonal plasmacytes (lambda vs kappa was 60%:40%) was found. Hodgkin lymphoma and MDS occurring after 4 years of carboplatin/paclitaxel therapy might be contributed to the accumulation of alkylator-related DNA damage. This emphasize the need of outlining a monitoring plan regarding development of secondary leukemia and other malignant hematological proliferations should be outlined in the protocols.

30786680	Human Growth Hormone	Hashimoto Disease	1	1	0	0	0.0	Papillary thyroid carcinoma in a patient with Turner syndrome treated with human growth hormone.	Thyroid cancer is a rare pathology in childhood and adolescence, being responsible for 1.5-3% of all carcinomas in this age group. Differentiated thyroid carcinoma is the most commonly found variant, especially papillary carcinoma of the thyroid (PCT). Currently available data support the hypothesis that growth hormone (GH) as well as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) can facilitate carcinogenesis. There is a confirmed role of the GH/IGF-1 axis in cancer progression as an initiator of tumorigenesis and neoplastic transformation, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Presently, application of recombinant GH is an acceptable method to treat female patients with growth failure during the course of Turner syndrome (TS). This article reports the case of a fourteen-year-old female patient with Turner syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnosed during GH treatment. The immunochemical analysis of tumour tissue in our patient revealed intensive brown reaction that labelled expression of the IGF-1R vs. traced reaction or its lack in normal thyroid tissue. A significant role is played by IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of invasion of thyroid cancer; however, this effect is complex, and how it works is not well established.

30069912	Hydrochloric Acid	Heartburn	0	0	0	0		Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type B agonist baclofen inhibits acid-induced excitation of secondary peristalsis but not heartburn sensation.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Acute esophageal acid infusion promotes distension-induced secondary peristalsis. The gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type B (GABA-B) receptors activation inhibits secondary peristalsis. This study aimed to test the hypothesis whether acid excitation of secondary peristalsis can be influenced by baclofen. METHODS: Secondary peristalsis was performed with intra-esophageal slow and rapid air injections in 13 healthy subjects. Direct esophageal infusion of 0.1 N HCl following pretreatment with placebo or baclofen was randomly performed at least 1 week apart. Symptom intensity, distension thresholds, and peristaltic parameters were determined and compared between each study protocol. RESULTS: The intensity of heartburn symptom in response to esophageal acid infusion was significantly greater with baclofen than the placebo (P = 0.002). The threshold volume of secondary peristalsis during slow air injections in response to acid infusion was significantly greater with baclofen than the placebo (P = 0.001). Baclofen significantly increased the threshold volume of secondary peristalsis during rapid air injections in response to acid infusion (P = 0.001). The frequency of secondary peristalsis in response to acid infusion was significantly decreased by baclofen as compared with the placebo (P = 0.001). Baclofen significantly decreased peristaltic amplitudes in response to acid infusion during rapid air injections (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type B agonist baclofen inhibits acid excitation of secondary peristalsis in human esophagus, which is probably mediated by both muscular and mucosal mechanoreceptors. This work supports the evidence of potential involvement of GABA-B receptors in negative modulation of acid excitation of esophageal perception as well as secondary peristalsis.
30729376	Rivaroxaban	Epistaxis	0	0	0	0		Shorter hospital stays in epistaxis patients with atrial fibrillation when taking rivaroxaban or apixaban versus phenprocoumon.	Patients taking oral anticoagulants (OACs) currently represent one-third of all patients treated for epistaxis and an upward trend is expected. New direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been on the market for approximately 10 years. DOACs are favoured over Vitamin K-Antagonists (VKAs) in the current guidelines. There are barely studies that investigate the impact of DOACs on patients with epistaxis. A retrospective study was performed analysing all patients who had stationary treatment for epistaxis from 01.01.2011 to 01.01.2018 in a tertiary care centre. In a total of 466 patients, 46.1% were on OACs. The main indication was atrial fibrillation (AF, 67.4%).The number of DOACs taken surpassed that of the VKAs during the past 2 years. The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the phenprocoumon group (3 +/- 0.2 days) in comparison to both the rivaroxaban (2.3 +/- 0.1) and the apixaban (2.2 +/- 0.1) groups (p = 0.005). Posterior epistaxis occurred more frequently in the phenprocoumon group (10.8%) than in the rivaroxaban (0%) and apixaban (0%) groups (p = 0.03). A correlation between CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score (risk score for apoplexy in patients with AF, p = 0.01), HAS-BLED score (score for assessment of major bleeding in patients taking anticoagulants with AF, p = 0.006), and length of hospital stay (p = 0.002) with recurrence of epistaxis was found. Shorter hospital stays and exclusively anterior bleeding was noted in AF patients taking rivaroxaban and apixaban, whereas AF patients taking phenprocoumon stayed in hospital longer and had more posterior bleeding.
29674658	Carboplatin	Thrombotic Microangiopathies	1	1	0	0	0.0	High-dose Carboplatin/Etoposide/Melphalan increases risk of thrombotic microangiopathy and organ injury after autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with neuroblastoma.	Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is an increasingly recognized complication of hematopoietic cell transplant that can result in multi-organ failure (MOF). Patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (aHCT) for neuroblastoma require good organ function to receive post-transplant radiation and immunotherapy. We examined TA-TMA incidence and transplant outcomes in patients with neuroblastoma receiving different transplant preparative regimens. Sixty patients underwent aHCT using high-dose chemotherapy: 41 patients received carboplatin/etoposide/melphalan (CEM), 13 patients busulfan/melphalan (Bu/Mel) and six patients received tandem transplant (cyclophosphamide/thiotepa and CEM). TA-TMA with MOF was diagnosed in 13 patients (21.7%) at a median of 18 days after aHCT. TA-TMA occurred in 12 patients receiving CEM and in 1 after cyclophosphamide/thiotepa. There were no incidences of TA-TMA after Bu/Mel regimen. Six of 13 patients with TA-TMA and MOF received terminal complement blocker eculizumab for therapy. They all recovered organ function and received planned post-transplant therapy. Out of seven patients who did not get eculizumab, two died from TA-TMA complications and four progressed to ESRD. We conclude that the CEM regimen is associated with a high incidence of clinically significant TA-TMA after aHCT and eculizumab can be safe and effective treatment option to remediate TA-TMA associated MOF.
29594793	Collagen	Keratitis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Sterile keratitis after uneventful corneal collagen cross-linking in a patient with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.	PURPOSE: To report on a keratoconus (KC) patient with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) who developed sterile keratitis after accelerated corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL). METHODS: An 18-year-old patient with ARS and KC who had previously undergone intrastromal ring segment implantation underwent accelerated CXL (9 mW/cm(2) UVA intensity for 10 min). RESULTS: After uneventful surgery, the patient presented with severe photophobia, redness of the eye, and decreased vision 72 h following the procedure. Slit-lamp examination showed anterior multiple superficial stromal infiltrates in the central cornea with an overlying epithelium defect. Due to the lack of pain and absence of any pathogen from corneal samples, a diagnosis of sterile keratitis was considered. A combination of topical antibiotic and corticosteroid regimen was administered. Three months after CXL slit-lamp examination showed a mild stromal scar overlying the central cornea, which did not decrease visual acuity. CONCLUSIONS: The mechanism by which the sterile keratitis occurs following CXL remains unclear. For our case, the reason of post-CXL sterile keratitis could be considered as an immune response due to the staphylococcal antigens. Furthermore, the possible developmental disturbance of corneal stroma in ARS might have contributed to the development of post-CXL sterile keratitis.

The interactions between opioids and gabapentin are more clinically relevant than ever. Prescriptions dispensed for gabapentin increased from 39 million in 2012 to 64 million in 2018 in the USA and are ever increasing. Authors present a challenging case of these interactions. A 58-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory failure and altered mental status. He was on high dose opioids and gabapentin as prescription medications. Despite full intensive care support and resolution of his respiratory failure with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, the patient did not regained consciousness. After ruling out other causes, the diagnosis of gabapentin withdrawal was considered. Gabapentin was administered by a nasogastric tube that quickly resulted in a reversal of his symptoms. We concluded that severe gabapentin withdrawal should be considered in patients on higher doses of gabapentin when it is stopped abruptly. In such patients, gabapentin should be replaced. As most patients are unable to swallow in this situation and intravenous formulation is not available, nasogastric tube can be used for replacement.

Patients with immunodeficiency or immunosuppression are at risk of developing a lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD). Methotrexate (MTX) is an iatrogenic cause of LPD, which in up to 50% cases occurs in extranodal sites. The occurrence of MTX-related LPD with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has rarely been reported. Moreover, there are no clear diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies for management of these lesions. In the present cases, discontinuing MTX and debridement of the necrotic bone were effective. This report describes 3 cases of MTX-related LPD in patients with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who presented with ONJ. The first patient was a 74-year-old man with RA who had received treatment with MTX for 7 years before presenting with ONJ and submental lymphadenopathy. The second patient was a 79-year-old woman who had been treated for 21 years with MTX and who presented with ONJ. The third patient was a 67-year-old man who had been treated with MTX for more than 15 years. In all 3 cases, biopsy, histology, and immunohistochemistry using a panel of lymphoid markers (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], CD79a, CD20, PAX-5, CD3, and CD30) resulted in the diagnosis of EBV-driven T-cell, B-cell, and Hodgkin-like LPD. All 3 patients recovered after cessation of MTX and surgical debridement. Biopsy examination, diagnostic immunohistochemistry using lymphoid immune markers, and imaging studies using computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron-emission tomographic computed tomography were useful for the correct diagnosis of this condition.

30153910	Carbon Monoxide	Asphyxia	0	0	0	0		Air pollution exposure during pregnancy: maternal asthma and neonatal respiratory outcomes.	PURPOSE: Maternal asthma increases adverse neonatal respiratory outcomes, and pollution may further increase risk. Air quality in relation to neonatal respiratory health has not been studied. METHODS: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), asphyxia, and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) were identified using medical records among 223,375 singletons from the Consortium on Safe Labor (2002-2008). Community Multiscale Air Quality models estimated pollutant exposures. Multipollutant Poisson regression models calculated adjusted relative risks of outcomes for interquartile range increases in average exposure. Maternal asthma and preterm delivery were evaluated as effect modifiers. RESULTS: TTN risk increased after particulate matter (PM) less than or equal to 10-micron exposure during preconception and trimester one (9-10%), and whole-pregnancy exposure to PM less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM(2.5); 17%) and carbon monoxide (CO; 10%). Asphyxia risk increased after exposure to PM(2.5) in trimester one (48%) and whole pregnancy (84%), CO in trimester two and whole pregnancy (28-32%), and consistently for ozone (34%-73%). RDS risk was associated with increased concentrations of nitrogen oxides (33%-42%) and ozone (9%-21%) during all pregnancy windows. Inverse associations were observed with several pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide. No interaction with maternal asthma was observed. Restriction to term births yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Several pollutants appear to increase neonatal respiratory outcome risks.

30878954	Calcium Carbonate	Acute Kidney Injury	1	1	0	1	0.0	Rare complication of milk-alkali ingestion: severe pancreatitis and acute kidney injury in a chronic hypocalcaemic patient with DiGeorge's syndrome.	Injudicious use of over-the-counter calcium supplements has resulted in increased incidences of hypercalcaemia and related complications. We present a case of acute pancreatitis in a chronic hypocalcaemic patient of DiGeorge's syndrome. The patient came into the ED with sepsis syndrome, right upper quadrant and epigastric pain and no obvious source of infection. Lab results and imaging were indicative of acute pancreatitis. There was severe renal dysfunction. The patient needed haemodialysis and had a prolonged stay in intensive care. The medical history was negative for biliary duct pathology or alcohol use. The patient had vomiting and diarrhoea in the nursing home for about a week, but she continued to receive her regular medications that included the calcium supplements and thiazide diuretics. It is likely that a complex interplay between calcium supplementation, dehydration and thiazide diuretics resulted in the development of acute pancreatitis and severe renal dysfunction in a chronic hypocalcaemic patient.
30293230	Curcumin	Inflammation	0	0	0	0		A combination of hydroxytyrosol, omega-3 fatty acids and curcumin improves pain and inflammation among early stage breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy: results of a pilot study.	PURPOSE: Breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapies face risks of relapse, increased rates of cardiovascular events, and toxicities of therapy such as aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS). C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for inflammation, is associated with breast cancer outcomes. We evaluated whether the olive-derived polyphenol hydroxytyrosol combined with omega-3 fatty acids and curcumin would reduce CRP and musculoskeletal symptoms in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant hormonal therapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm, clinical trial enrolled post-menopausal breast cancer patients (n = 45) with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) taking predominantly aromatase inhibitors to receive a combination of hydroxytyrosol, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin for 1 month. CRP, other inflammation-associated cytokines, and pain scores on the Brief Pain Inventory were measured before therapy, at the end of therapy and 1 month after completion of therapy. RESULTS: CRP levels declined during the therapy [from 8.2 +/- 6.4 mg/L at baseline to 5.3 +/- 3.2 mg/L (p = 0.014) at 30 days of treatment], and remained decreased during the additional 1 month off therapy. Subjects with the highest baseline CRP levels had the greatest decrease with the therapy. Pain scores also decreased during the therapy. There were no significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of hydroxytyrosol, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin reduced inflammation as indicated by a reduction in CRP and reduced pain in patients with aromatase-induced musculoskeletal symptoms. Longer studies comparing this combination to other anti-inflammatories in larger groups of patients with clinical outcome endpoints are warranted.

Some polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals are known human carcinogens and the combined toxicity data of these co-contaminants are important for assessing their health risk. In this study, we have evaluated the combined genotoxicity, AhR activity and cell cycle parameters of four PAHs (benzo[a]pyrene (Ba]P), naphthalene (Nap), phenanthrene (Phe) and pyrene (Pyr)) and three metals (arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb)) in HepG2 cells using a flow cytometry based micronucleus (MN) test CAFLUX assay and nuclear fluorescence assay, respectively. The mixtures of B[a]P and metals induced a maximum of four fold increase in the MN formation compared to B[a]P alone. The higher combination of PAHs and metals did not significantly increase the MN formation. The mixtures of metals or non-carcinogenic PAHs were found to increase or decrease the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation of B[a]P in HepG2 cell based CAFLUX assay. Overall, the results showed that combined genotoxicity of PAHs and metals in HepG2 cells vary depending on the concentrations and number of the chemicals that are present in the mixtures and the effects of higher order combinations appear to be largely unpredictable from binary combinations. In this study, we have demonstrated the use of flow cytometry based MN test to screen the genotoxicity of environmental chemicals and its mixtures.

30792992	Sodium Chloride	Acute Kidney Injury	0	0	0	0		Evaluation of Pathological Association between Stroke-Related QTL and Salt-Induced Renal Injury in Stroke-Prone Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat.	The stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) suffers from severe hypertension and hypertensive organ damage such as cerebral stroke and kidney injury under salt-loading. By a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis between SHRSP and SHR (the stroke-resistant parental strain of SHRSP), two major QTLs for stroke susceptibility were identified on chromosomes 1 and 18 of SHRSP, which were confirmed in congenic strains constructed between SHRSP and SHR. As the progression of renal dysfunction was suggested to be one of the key factors inducing stroke in SHRSP, we examined effects of the stroke-related QTLs on kidney injury using two congenic strains harboring either of SHRSP-derived fragments of chromosomes 1 and 18 in the SHR genome. The congenic strains were challenged with 1% NaCl solution for 4 weeks; measurement of systolic blood pressure and urinary isoprostane level (a marker for oxidative stress) and evaluation of renal injury by quantification of genetic marker expression and histological examination were performed. We found that the congenic rats with SHRSP-derived fragment of chromosome 18 showed more severe renal damage with higher expression of Col1alpha-1 (a genetic marker for renal fibrosis) and higher urinary isoprostane level. In contrast, the fragment of chromosome 1 from SHRSP did not give such effects on SHR. Blood pressure was not greater in either of the congenic strains when compared with SHR. We concluded that the QTL region on chromosome 18 might deteriorate salt-induced renal injury in SHR through a blood pressure-independent mechanism.
30879013	Cannabis	Panic Disorder	1	1	0	0	0.0	Comparison of Cortisol Stress Response in Patients with Panic Disorder, Cannabis-Induced Panic Disorder, and Healthy Controls.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Little research effort has so far been dedicated to the analysis of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis of aetiologically differing subgroups of patients with panic disorder (PD). The current study aimed at a deeper understanding of the cortisol stress response in cannabis-induced PD (CIPD) patients. METHODS: Matched groups of 7 PD patients (mean age +/- SD: 32.95 +/- 9.04 years), 7 CIPD patients (31.94 +/- 8.40 years), and 7 healthy controls (HC) (31.13 +/- 8.57 years) were included in the study. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used for stress induction. Salivary cortisol samples were collected and panic- and depression-related questionnaires were applied. RESULTS: A stress response to the TSST was found in 28.6% of PD patients, in 51.1% of CIPD patients, and in 100% of HC subjects. Statistical analyses revealed a cortisol hyporesponsiveness in PD and CIPD patients. While cortisol values of PD patients and HC participants differed significantly, CIPD patients' cortisol courses balanced between those of PD patients and HC subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings show a distinctive pattern of the stress-induced cortisol reaction in CIPD patients, which is markedly different from the hormonal response in PD patients as well as HC subjects. Previous findings of cortisol hyporesponsiveness in PD patients compared to HC subjects were confirmed.

30154038	Esomeprazole	Hyponatremia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Associations of proton pump inhibitors and hospitalization due to hyponatremia: A population-based case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Small observational studies and case reports have indicated that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may cause hyponatremia. Whether there is a difference between the individual PPIs is yet unknown. Since PPIs are one of the most commonly prescribed groups of drugs, even a rare adverse reaction may have large implications. The objective was to study the association between PPIs and hospitalization due to hyponatremia. METHODS: This register-based case-control study was based on the general Swedish population. Patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of hyponatremia (n = 14,359) were compared to matched controls (n = 57,383). The association between newly initiated (</=90 days) and ongoing PPI use was explored using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for concomitant drugs, medical conditions, previous hospitalizations and socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Adjusted ORs (95%CI) for hospitalization due to hyponatremia, compared to controls, were for newly initiated: omeprazole 2.67 (2.37-3.01); pantoprazole 2.06 (1.32-3.19); lansoprazole 1.19 (0.72-1.94); esomeprazole 2.89 (2.21-3.79) and any PPI 2.78 (2.48-3.11). Only one individual had been newly initiated on rabeprazole and had been hospitalized due to hyponatremia. Adjusted ORs (95%CI) for individuals with ongoing treatment were for: omeprazole 1.04 (0.97-1.11); pantoprazole 0.81 (0.62-1.05); lansoprazole 0.90 (0.70-1.15); rabeprazole 3.34 (0.84-11.43); esomeprazole 1.12 (0.94-1.33) and any PPI 1.04 (0.98-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of lansoprazole, this study suggests an association between any newly initiated PPI-treatment and hospitalization due to hyponatremia. Ongoing PPI use was not associated with an increased risk.

30213441	Methamphetamine	Brain Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Severe neurologic and hepatic toxicity in a newborn prenatally exposed to methamphetamine. A case report.	OBJECTIVE: In the recent years the increase of methamphetamines (MTA) abusers women has become an emerging problem. Very little data has been published regarding the effects of prenatal MTA exposure. We describe a case of MTA related toxicity in a term newborn which have early onset of neonatal encephalopathy and liver failure. CASE REPORT: A term infant born to a MTA abuser mother developed seizures and severe neurological symptoms shortly after birth. Methamphetamine was detected both in maternal and in neonatal urine. The laboratoristic tests revealed severe hepatic insufficiency, coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Due to neonatal encephalopathy the newborn underwent hypothermia. Phenobarbital, fresh frozen plasma, platelet transfusions and vitamin K were administered. Cranial ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed diffuse white matter damage and two ischemic-hemorrhagic cerebral lesions. Gradually the clinical conditions improved, at 1 month MRI showed a stabilization of cerebral lesions with residual diffuse leukomalacia. Physiotherapy and neurological follow up is ongoing to evaluate the long term effects. CONCLUSIONS: although infrequent, MTA-related toxicity should be suspected in infants with neurologic and hepatic symptoms. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings in order to identify newborns at high risk of acute MTA toxicity in time to provide them the appropriate support.

29592917	Etanercept	Opportunistic Infections	1	0	0	0		Serious infection across biologic-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis: results from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the incidence of serious infection (SI) across biologic drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register for Rheumatoid Arthritis (BSRBR-RA). METHODS: The BSRBR-RA is a prospective observational cohort study. This analysis included patients with RA starting a new biologic. The primary outcome was SI defined as an infectious event requiring admission to hospital, intravenous antibiotics or resulting in death. Event rates were calculated and compared across biologics using Cox proportional hazards with adjustment for potential confounders. Secondary outcomes were the rate of infection by organ class and 30-day mortality following infection. RESULTS: This analysis included 19 282 patients with 46 771 years of follow-up. The incidence of SI was 5.51 cases per 100 patient years for the entire cohort (95% CI 5.29 to 5.71). Compared with etanercept, tocilizumab had a higher risk of SI (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.47) and certolizumab pegol a lower risk of SI (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.97) in the fully adjusted model. The 30-day mortality following SI was 10.4% (95% CI 9.2% to 11.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of SI was lower with certolizumab pegol than etanercept in the primary analysis but the result was no longer significant in several sensitivity analyses performed suggesting residual confounding may account for the observed difference. From these results, it would be wrong to conclude that certolizumab pegol has a lower rate of SI than other biologics; however, the risk does not appear to be significantly higher as has previously been suggested.

30526810	Methotrexate	Lymphoma	1	1	0	0	0.0	Risk of malignant lymphoma in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and methotrexate .	OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether using biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) further increases the risk of malignant lymphoma in patients with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing methotrexate therapy using spontaneous adverse reaction databases in different countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient data were acquired from the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER), and the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database (CVARD) from the first quarter of 2004 to the end of 2015. Data subset analysis was performed to investigate whether the use of bDMARDs further increased the risk of malignant lymphoma in patients receiving methotrexate therapy. RESULTS: The FAERS subset data indicated a significant association between Hodgkin lymphoma and methotrexate with infliximab (reporting odds ratio (ROR): 8.28. 95% CI: 5.70 - 12.02; information component (IC): 2.04, 95% CI: 1.59 - 2.49). In addition, signal scores suggested that methotrexate with infliximab (ROR: 3.26. 95% CI: 2.68 - 3.98; IC: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.58) was significantly associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The CVARD subset data also indicated a significant association between NHL and methotrexate with infliximab (ROR: 22.82. 95% CI: 5.02 - 103.78; IC: 1.77, 95% CI: 0.13 - 3.41). However, the JADER subset data revealed no significant associations. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that using infliximab further increases the risk of malignant lymphoma in patients receiving methotrexate therapy. .
28960092	Azithromycin	Cardiovascular Diseases	0	0	0	0		Appraisal of the cardiovascular risks of azithromycin: an observational analysis.	AIM: To assess the association of cardiovascular mortality in patients prescribed azithromycin compared with patients prescribed alternative antibiotics in an outpatient setting. METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational analysis using the South Carolina Medicaid claims and pharmacy databases over the years from 2000 to 2011 housed at the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. Study antibiotics included azithromycin, amoxicillin, clindamycin, clarithromycin and quinolones (levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin), and excluded patients at a high risk of death from causes other than the study antibiotics. This study used both matching and regression adjustment with propensity scores to reduce possible bias in the estimated treatment (group) effect from confounders. RESULTS: The total number of prescriptions evaluated in the study include: 283,743 azithromycin; 143,191 amoxicillin; 52,714 clindamycin; 38,133 clarithromycin and 49,734 for the quinolones. After propensity score weighting, cardiac deaths per million within the first 5 days were: 84.6 for azithromycin, 78.3 for clarithromycin, 69.4 for amoxicillin, 61.6 for quinolones and 15.0 for clindamycin. Our multivariate models reveal that the study antibiotics' (amoxicillin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin) mortality rates are not statistically different from azithromycin in any time interval (days: 0-5, 6-10, 0-10 and 0-30). In comparison with previous studies, the results are consistent in Amoxicillin. In the first 5 and 10 days, it is associated with lower odds of cardiovascular death than azithromycin (5 days: odds ratio [OR]: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.25-1.99]; 10 days: OR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.39-2.14]). However, we find no statistically significant difference between the two antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the odds of cardiovascular mortality between azithromycin and other antibiotics are not statistically significantly different and previous published findings may not be applicable to the general population. Additionally our results suggest that while we cannot rule out the increased risk of cardiovascular death from azithromycin in patients at low risk of death, the risk may not be as large initial studies suggest. Further research is needed to define the population at greatest risk.

30612830	Dexamethasone	Diabetes Complications	0	0	0	0		The Effects of Peri-Operative Dexamethasone on Patients Undergoing Total Hip or Knee Arthroplasty: Is It Safe for Diabetics?	BACKGROUND: Peri-operative dexamethasone has been shown to effectively reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting and aide in analgesia after total joint arthroplasty (TJA); however, systemic glucocorticoid therapy has many adverse effects. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of dexamethasone on prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and blood glucose levels in patients undergoing TJA. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients receiving primary TJA from 2011 to 2015 (n = 2317) was conducted. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts: dexamethasone (n = 1426) and no dexamethasone (n = 891); these groups were subdivided into diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The primary outcome was PJI; secondary measures included glucose levels and pre-operative hemoglobin A1c (A1c) values. Statistics were carried out using logistic and regression models. RESULTS: Of the 2317 joints, 1.12% developed PJI; this was not affected by dexamethasone (P = .166). Diabetics were found to have higher rate of infection (P < .001); however, diabetics who received dexamethasone were not found to have a significantly higher infection rate that non-diabetics (P = .646). Blood glucose levels were found to increase post-operatively, and dexamethasone did not increase this change (P = .537). Diabetes (P < .001) and increasing hemoglobin A1c (P < .001) were also associated with increased serum glucose levels; however, this was not influenced by dexamethasone (P = .595). CONCLUSION: Although diabetic patients were found to have a higher infection rate overall, this was not affected by administration of intravenous dexamethasone, nor was the post-operative elevation in serum glucose levels. In this study population, peri-operative intravenous dexamethasone did not increase the rate of PJI and was safe to administer in patients undergoing TJA.
30279015	Celecoxib	Cardiovascular Diseases	0	0	0	0		BOXIT-A Randomised Phase III Placebo-controlled Trial Evaluating the Addition of Celecoxib to Standard Treatment of Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder (CRUK/07/004).	BACKGROUND: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) has a significant risk of recurrence despite adjuvant intravesical therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether celecoxib, a cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitor, reduces the risk of recurrence in NMIBC patients receiving standard treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: BOXIT (CRUK/07/004, ISRCTN84681538) is a double-blinded, phase III, randomised controlled trial. Patients aged >/=18 yr with intermediate- or high-risk NMIBC were accrued across 51 UK centres between 1 November 2007 and 23 July 2012. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised (1:1) to celecoxib 200mg twice daily or placebo for 2 yr. Patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC were recommended to receive six weekly mitomycin C instillations; high-risk NMIBC cases received six weekly bacillus Calmette-Guerin and maintenance therapy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was time to disease recurrence. Analysis was by intention to treat. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 472 patients were randomised (236:236). With median follow-up of 44 mo (interquartile range: 36-57), 3-yr recurrence-free rate (95% confidence interval) was as follows: celecoxib 68% (61-74%) versus placebo 64% (57-70%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.82 [0.60-1.12], p=0.2). There was no difference in high-risk (HR 0.77 [0.52-1.15], p=0.2) or intermediate-risk (HR 0.90 [0.55-1.48], p=0.7) NMIBC. Subgroup analysis suggested that time to recurrence was longer in pT1 NMIBC patients treated with celecoxib compared with those receiving placebo (HR 0.53 [0.30-0.94], interaction test p=0.04). The 3-yr progression rates in high-risk patients were low: 10% (6.5-17%) and 9.7% (6.0-15%) in celecoxib and placebo arms, respectively. Incidence of serious cardiovascular events was higher in celecoxib (5.2%) than in placebo (1.7%) group (difference +3.4% [-0.3% to 7.2%], p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: BOXIT did not show that celecoxib reduces the risk of recurrence in intermediate- or high-risk NMIBC, although celecoxib was associated with delayed time to recurrence in pT1 NMIBC patients. The increased risk of cardiovascular events does not support the use of celecoxib. PATIENT SUMMARY: Celecoxib was not shown to reduce the risk of recurrence in intermediate- or high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), although celecoxib was associated with delayed time to recurrence in pT1 NMIBC patients. The increased risk of cardiovascular events does not support the use of celecoxib.
30875000	Radium	Anemia	0	0	0	0		Three-year follow-up of a phase II study of radium-223 dichloride in Japanese patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.	BACKGROUND: Radium-223 is a first-in-class targeted alpha therapy to prolong overall survival (OS) in castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases (mCRPC). The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term safety with radium-223 in Japanese patients with mCRPC. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic mCRPC, >/= 2 bone metastases and no known visceral metastases received up to 6 injections of radium-223 (55 kBq/kg), one every 4 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) considered to be related to radium-223 were reported until 3 years after the first injection. Pre-specified conditions, such as acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, primary bone cancer, or other primary malignancies, were reported regardless of causality. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients enrolled in the study, 44 (89.8%) entered the survival follow-up period and 33 (67.3%) died. Throughout the entire study, there were no reports of second primary malignancy or other pre-specified conditions. Eight patients (16.3%) experienced post-treatment drug-related AEs, which were all hematological (anemia and decreased lymphocyte, platelet, and white blood cell counts). No serious post-treatment drug-related AEs were reported. Updated median OS was 19.3 months (95% CI: 14.2, 28.5). CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with symptomatic mCRPC and bone metastases, radium-223 had a favorable long-term safety profile with no second primary malignancies reported. Taken together with median OS, which was comparable to that in the pivotal phase III ALSYMPCA study, these results support continued benefit from radium-223 in Japanese patients with mCRPC.
29873529	Aprepitant	Nausea	0	0	0	0		Safety of HTX-019 (intravenous aprepitant) and fosaprepitant in healthy subjects.	AIM: Evaluate safety of HTX-019, a novel polysorbate 80- and synthetic surfactant-free intravenous formulation of neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist aprepitant for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. METHODS: Two open-label, randomized, two-way crossover studies evaluated treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in 200 healthy subjects. Subjects received HTX-019 130 mg (30-min infusion) and fosaprepitant 150 mg (20- or 30-min infusion), with >/=7-day washout between doses. RESULTS: Less than or equal to 30 min after start of infusion, TEAEs occurred in 5 (3%) HTX-019 and 30 (15%) fosaprepitant recipients. No HTX-019 recipients had infusion-site adverse events, versus 15 (8%) fosaprepitant recipients. Treatment-related dyspnea occurred in one HTX-019 and six fosaprepitant recipients. No severe/serious TEAEs occurred; all TEAEs resolved. CONCLUSION: HTX-019 may provide a safer aprepitant formulation than fosaprepitant for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting prevention.

We assessed the real-life use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and exclusion criteria for randomized trials. From 2013 to 2016, 3,578 of 18,853 patients (19%) had exclusion criteria. Irrespective of which anticoagulant was chosen, they had more VTE recurrences (hazard ratio (HR): 3.10; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.47-3.88), major bleeds (HR: 4.10; 95% CI: 3.38-4.96), and deaths (HR: 9.47; 95% CI: 8.46-10.6) than those without exclusion criteria. During initial therapy, no patient with exclusion criteria on DOACs (n = 115) recurred, but those on rivaroxaban bled less often (adjusted HR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.04-0.79) than those on unfractionated heparin (n = 224) and similar to those (n = 3,172) on low-molecular-weight (LMWH) heparin. For long-term therapy, patients on rivaroxaban (n = 151) had nonsignificantly fewer VTE recurrences (adjusted HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.08-1.32) and major bleeds (adjusted HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.15-1.15) than those on LMWH (n = 2,071). The efficacy and safety of DOACs were similar to standard therapy.

We present a case of a possible amoxicillin-induced anaphylaxis in a sensitive woman triggered by an instance of oral sexual contact with a man who was taking amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment.To our knowledge, this is the first case reported of a suspicion of amoxicillin-induced anaphylaxis in a woman after a sexual contact with a man who was taking the drug, we hypothesised an oral drug transfer through semen.Studies about amoxicillin concentrations achieved in semen after a drug intake are scarce. There are few cases reported of hypersensitivity reactions induced by drugs transported in semen but we have found some concern in sensitive patients about the possibility of transference of allergens via sexual intercourse. As clinicians, we consider that it is important to be aware of the existence of this possibility both in the diagnosis and in the prevention of anaphylactic reactions.

Cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy is a well-known but uncommon disease, and the physician must maintain a high index of suspicion in order to make a timely diagnosis. We report two patients with cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy. Both patients developed progressively worsening symptoms of cobalt toxicity following revision of a fractured ceramic-on-ceramic total hip replacement to a metal-on-polyethylene bearing. In both patients, echocardiography showed LV hypertrophy, biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a large amount of pericardial effusion. Due to decompensated heart failure, both patients were initially considered candidates for heart transplantation. One patient was diagnosed with cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy before transplantation. He received cobalt chelation therapy and revision surgery, which led to complete recovery of heart function. In the other patient, the diagnosis was not made until the time of heart transplantation. The gross examination of the explanted heart revealed typical features of cobalt cardiotoxicity, which was then diagnosed as cobalt-induced cardiomyopathy. These cases emphasise the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment of cobalt intoxication.

31049133	Scopolamine	Amnesia	1	0	0	0		Sulforaphane-Enriched Broccoli Sprouts Pretreated by Pulsed Electric Fields Reduces Neuroinflammation and Ameliorates Scopolamine-Induced Amnesia in Mouse Brain through Its Antioxidant Ability via Nrf2-HO-1 Activation.	Activated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a key pathogenic role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and ischemia. Sulforaphane is an active compound produced after conversion of glucoraphanin by the myrosinase enzyme in broccoli (Brassica oleracea var) sprouts. Dietary broccoli extract as well as sulforaphane has previously known to mitigate inflammatory conditions in aged models involving microglial activation. Here, we produced sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprouts through the pretreatment of pulsed electric fields in order to trigger the biological role of normal broccoli against lipopolysaccharide-activated microglia. The sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprouts showed excellent potency against neuroinflammation conditions, as evidenced by its protective effects in both 6 and 24 h of microglial activation in vitro. We further postulated the underlying mechanism of action of sulforaphane in broccoli sprouts, which was the inhibition of an inflammatory cascade via the downregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Simultaneously, sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprouts inhibited the LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and the secretions of inflammatory proteins (iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, PGE2, etc.), which are responsible for the inflammatory cascades in both acute and chronic inflammation. It also upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in normal and activated microglia followed by the lowered neuronal apoptosis induced by activated microglia. Based on these results, it may exhibit anti-inflammatory effects via the NF-kappaB and Nrf2 pathways. Interestingly, sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprouts improved the scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice through Nrf2 activation, inhibiting neuronal apoptosis particularly through inhibition of caspase-3 activation which could lead to the neuroprotection against neurodegenerative disorders. The present study suggests that sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprouts might be a potential nutraceutical with antineuroinflammatory and neuroprotective activities.

The combination of carmustine, etoposide, aracytin, and melphalan(BEAM) conditioning regimen in autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) is widely used in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin lymphoma. It is also an option in patients with very-high risk aggressive NHL in first complete remission (CR). Recently, a phase Ib-II feasibility study using bendamustine replacing carmustine (BCNU) was reported. We report herein a safety and efficacy analysis of bendamustine-EAM (BeEAM) with a control BEAM counterpart paired cohort (1/2). One hundred and two patients were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were not reached and seemed to be comparable between both groups. However, grade III or greater diarrhea was significantly higher in BeEAM patients (44 vs. 15%, p = .002). The median number of days with fever >38  degrees C was significantly higher in BeEAM group (5.5 vs. 2, p < .001). This case-control study suggests that BeEAM followed by ASCT using bendamustine at 100 mg/m(2)/d is effective but has a different toxicity profile than the BEAM regimen.

30737860	Vancomycin	Acute Kidney Injury	1	1	0	0	0.0	Paediatric acute kidney injury induced by vancomycin monotherapy versus combined vancomycin and meropenem.	WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Increasing reports of the combined use of vancomycin (VAN) and piperacillin/tazobactam leading to higher nephrotoxicity have led to carbapenems being recommended as an alternative option to combine with VAN when nephrotoxicity is a major concern. However, whether carbapenems also increase the nephrotoxicity of VAN is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether meropenem is a suitable drug to combine with VAN based on whether meropenem enhances the nephrotoxicity of VAN. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled hospitalized children ranging in age from 1 month to 18 years at two tertiary hospitals from 1 February 2017 to 1 February 2018. Patients treated with either VAN or combined VAN and meropenem (VM) for more than 48 hours were eligible for inclusion. Those with underlying kidney diseases or abnormal age-adjusted baseline serum creatinine (SCr) at admission were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to the patients to balance factors associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). In addition, VAN trough concentrations were also compared. AKI was defined as an increase in SCr by >/=50% from baseline or by >/=0.3 mg/dL sustained over at least two consecutive measurements ranging from the time of initiation until 72 hours after the completion of VAN therapy. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The eligibility criteria were met by 183 of 243 identified patients: 101 patients received VAN alone and 82 received VM. PSM resulted in 154 hospitalized children being included (77 patients in each group). The incidence of AKI was 10.7% (8/77) in both of the compared groups, while the VAN trough concentration was significantly higher in the VM group (9.0 mg/L) than in the VAN group (6.6 mg/L, P = 0.007) after controlling for confounders. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Despite the elevated VAN trough concentration, meropenem did not increase the nephrotoxicity of VAN and might therefore be an acceptable antibiotic to combine with VAN when necessary.

30766593	Dexmedetomidine	Hypotension	0	0	0	0		A comparison of risk of hypotension using standard doses of remifentanil versus dexmedetomidine infusions in adult patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi.	BACKGROUND: Remifentanil and dexmedetomidine are common agents used in general anaesthesia, monitored anaesthesia care and critical care. When combined with inhaled or intravenous anaesthetic agents intra-operatively, they provide analgesia, lower general anaesthetic requirements and provide sedation and analgesia in the peri-operative period if indicated. Pharmacodynamically, they cause hypotension and bradycardia which are reversible if well managed. Past studies of these drugs have shown a significant proportion of patients with hypotension when compared with similar agents or in isolation. This study compares these two drugs on the effect of hypotension when used as adjuncts to general anaesthesia at low dose standard rate of infusions. OBJECTIVE: To compare the proportion of hypotension episodes in a group of adult patients receiving dexmedetomidine infusion at 0.4mcg/kg/hr versus a group receiving remifentanil infusion at 0.2mcg/kg/min, severity of hypotension and physician interventions in each group. METHODS: One hundred and four patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia were randomized into two groups: Control group; received remifentanil infusion at 0.2mcg/kg/minIntervention group; received dexmedetomidine at 0.4mcg/kg/hr.General anaesthesia was standardized in both groups. The patients were blinded to the study. Baseline blood pressures of all patients were determined prior to induction. The patient's demographic characteristics were recorded. The number of patients who developed hypotension, the frequency of hypotension and the physician interventions were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: The age and gender characteristics were different between the two groups (p values <0.023 and 0.05 respectively) however they did not affect the proportion of patients with hypotension. The weight, baseline pressures and ASA status of the patients within the groups were similar. The operative procedures varied within the groups. General surgery did not influence the outcome of hypotension in both arms. The duration of surgery in remifentanil group exceeded that of Dexmedetomidine p value<0.0005 however the time to the first episode of hypotension was similar between the groups. The episodes of hypotension were fewer in the dexmedetomidine arm and the proportion of patients with hypotension were higher in the remifentanil arm, p value<0.001, R.R 0. = 0.5938, 95% C.I= 0.329-0.819 The physician interventions administered were similar between the two groups except the use of ephedrine between the groups. CONCLUSION: Among this population, at standard infusion rates, the proportion of patients that risk hypotension was greater in those undergoing elective surgery receiving remifentanil at 0.2mcg/kg/min than in dexmedetomidine at 0.4mcg/kg/hr under isoflurane based anaesthesia.
28853765	Rivaroxaban	Postoperative Complications	1	1	0	0	0.0	Pulmonary embolism four days after interruption of therapy with rivaroxaban.	Thrombosis after cessation of anticoagulation, also named rebound thrombosis, is a matter of concern and controversy. There are only few published data about occurrence of rebound thrombosis associated with non-vitamin K-antagonist oral anticoagulant drugs (NOACs). We report on a 58-year-old male with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) with a CHA(2)DS(2)VASC score of 4 who developed central pulmonary embolism four days after interruption of rivaroxaban because of parotid surgery. He had received 40 mg enoxaparin/d. The parotid gland was partially resected within 6 hours without blood loss. Pulmonary embolism and AF occurred on the first postoperative day. He recovered with low-molecular-weight heparin in therapeutic dosages and amiodarone and was discharged with phenprocoumon. The relevance of a rivaroxaban rebound phenomenon, manifesting as arterial embolism, stroke or venous thromboembolism should be clarified. It should be assessed if rebound-phenomena also exist for the NOACs dabigatran, apixaban and edoxaban. Thus, the randomized trials and registries investigating patients with AF or venous thromboembolism should be re-analysed and, based on these data, recommendations should be developed for situations in which NOAC-therapy has to be interrupted or ceased.
30277163	Sodium Glutamate	Obesity	1	1	0	0	0.0	Anaemogenic, Obesogenic and Thermogenic Potentials of Graded Doses of Monosodium Glutamate Sub-acutely Fed to Experimental Wistar Rats.	BACKGROUND: Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is one of the most commonly used food additives for the enhancement of food taste and flavour. There are several conflicting reports of toxicity or otherwise safety of the compound, which raises a growing concern regarding the safety of monosodium glutamate as a food additive. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we sought to investigate the effect of monosodium glutamate on body weight, feed consumption, body temperature and some haematological parameters. METHODOLOGY: Twenty adult Wistar rats divided into four groups of five rats each were used for the study. Rats in groups 1, 2 and 3 were given feed thoroughly mixed with 3, 6 and 9 g of monosodium glutamate respectively for 14 days, while rats in group 4 (Control) were given only the feed for the same period of time. Body weight, temperature, feed consumption, and some haematological parameters were measured before the addition of the compound to the feed and thereafter for every 2 days for a period of 14 days. RESULTS: Our findings indicated significant changes (P < 0.05) in the red blood cells (RBC) count, packed cell volume (PCV), as well as body temperature in all the treated groups compared to the control group. The result also revealed a significant dose-dependent increase in body weight in the groups treated with 6 and 9 g of monosodium glutamate compared to the control, the body weight correlated positively with the duration of monosodium glutamate consumption. CONCLUSION: The current data suggest that consumption of high doses/quantity of monosodium glutamate for a long duration of time could lead to anaemia due to a decrease in red blood cell count and packed cell volume and obesity resulting from an increase in body weight gain.
29498948	Propofol	Postoperative Complications	0	0	0	0		Inhalational versus Intravenous Induction of Anesthesia in Children with a High Risk of Perioperative Respiratory Adverse Events: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: Limited evidence suggests that children have a lower incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events when intravenous propofol is used compared with inhalational sevoflurane for the anesthesia induction. Limiting these events can improve recovery time as well as decreasing surgery waitlists and healthcare costs. This single center open-label randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of the anesthesia induction technique on the occurrence of perioperative respiratory adverse events in children at high risk of those events. METHODS: Children (N = 300; 0 to 8 yr) with at least two clinically relevant risk factors for perioperative respiratory adverse events and deemed suitable for either technique of anesthesia induction were recruited and randomized to either intravenous propofol or inhalational sevoflurane. The primary outcome was the difference in the rate of occurrence of perioperative respiratory adverse events between children receiving intravenous induction and those receiving inhalation induction of anesthesia. RESULTS: Children receiving intravenous propofol were significantly less likely to experience perioperative respiratory adverse events compared with those who received inhalational sevoflurane after adjusting for age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status and weight (perioperative respiratory adverse event: 39/149 [26%] vs. 64/149 [43%], relative risk [RR]: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.3, P = 0.002, respiratory adverse events at induction: 16/149 [11%] vs. 47/149 [32%], RR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.8 to 5. 2, P < 0.001).

29498948	Propofol	Respiration Disorders	0	0	0	0		Inhalational versus Intravenous Induction of Anesthesia in Children with a High Risk of Perioperative Respiratory Adverse Events: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: Limited evidence suggests that children have a lower incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events when intravenous propofol is used compared with inhalational sevoflurane for the anesthesia induction. Limiting these events can improve recovery time as well as decreasing surgery waitlists and healthcare costs. This single center open-label randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of the anesthesia induction technique on the occurrence of perioperative respiratory adverse events in children at high risk of those events. METHODS: Children (N = 300; 0 to 8 yr) with at least two clinically relevant risk factors for perioperative respiratory adverse events and deemed suitable for either technique of anesthesia induction were recruited and randomized to either intravenous propofol or inhalational sevoflurane. The primary outcome was the difference in the rate of occurrence of perioperative respiratory adverse events between children receiving intravenous induction and those receiving inhalation induction of anesthesia. RESULTS: Children receiving intravenous propofol were significantly less likely to experience perioperative respiratory adverse events compared with those who received inhalational sevoflurane after adjusting for age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status and weight (perioperative respiratory adverse event: 39/149 [26%] vs. 64/149 [43%], relative risk [RR]: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.3, P = 0.002, respiratory adverse events at induction: 16/149 [11%] vs. 47/149 [32%], RR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.8 to 5. 2, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Where clinically appropriate, anesthesiologists should consider using an intravenous propofol induction technique in children who are at high risk of experiencing perioperative respiratory adverse events.

Excessive ethanol (EtOH) intake affects cognitive function and leads to permanent learning and memory deficits. EtOH-induced neuroinflammation plays an important role in EtOH neurotoxicity. Studies have shown that EtOH activates microglia and induces an inflammatory response. Resveratrol (Rsv) is a natural polyphenol found in a wide variety of plants and fruits, and produces the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system. However, effect of Rsv on EtOH-induced neuroinflammation is still unknown. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of Rsv in the context of EtOH-induced neurotoxicity and the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in the effect. The results showed that treatment of rats with Rsv prevented the deficits of spatial reference memory induced by EtOH and mitigated EtOH-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and decreasing the levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The further studies indicated that Rsv reduced TLR2 expression in vivo and in vitro, and downregulated expression of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). These data demonstrate that Rsv alleviates the ethanol-induced neuroinflammation via inhibition of TLR2-MyD88-NF-kappaB signal pathway.
29902447	Morphine	Urinary Retention	0	0	0	0		Randomized controlled trial of belladonna and opiate suppository during intravesical onabotulinum toxin A injection.	"BACKGROUND: Intravesical injection with onabotulinum toxin A injection can be performed in-office under local anesthesia. Rectally administered pain medication presents a potentially feasible and previously uninvestigated adjunct to office-based anesthesia protocols. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether adding a belladonna and opiate suppository to standard lidocaine instillation resulted in reduction of bladder injection pain during onabotulinum toxin A injection procedure. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients undergoing onabotulinum toxin A bladder injection at a single clinic. Patients age >/=18 years, who met clinical criteria for invasive treatment of refractory urinary symptoms, had previously documented postvoid residual volumes <150 mL, and elected for in-office intravesical onabotulinum toxin A injection were eligible to participate. Participants were randomized by computer-generated block randomization to receive a belladonna and opiate (belladonna alkaloid with morphine 16.2/7.5 mg) or placebo suppository. Suppositories were placed immediately prior to lidocaine-based anesthesia, which all participants received. All participants underwent a standardized injection procedure using the same rigid cystoscope, needle type, and injection pattern (20 injections total). A 0-10 numeric rating scale was used to assess pain intensity before anesthesia and suppository, 40 minutes after administration of anesthesia and suppository, after first 10 bladder injections, and immediately after completion of 20 injections. Pain increase during procedure was calculated using the difference between score 40 minutes after administration of anesthesia and suppository and score after first 10 bladder injections. Postvoid residual were measured immediately postprocedure and 2 weeks later. Patient satisfaction with pain control was measured using a Likert scale. Our primary outcome was change in pain level from anesthetic baseline to midprocedure (score after first 10 bladder injections to score 40 minutes after administration of anesthesia and suppository). A final sample size of 26 patients was needed to have 80% power (alpha = 0.05) to detect a 50% reduction in bladder injection pain during the procedure as defined by our primary outcome. An intent-to-treat approach was used for all analyses. RESULTS: In all, 26 participants were enrolled and randomized with 13 in each study arm. Participants in the treatment group were slightly older than in the placebo group (P = .05); there were no statistically significant differences in medical comorbidities. Median score after first 10 bladder injections to score 40 minutes after administration of anesthesia and suppository for the placebo group and treatment group was 4 (range 1-10) and 5 (range 0,9), respectively (P = .94). Median scores immediately after completion of 20 injections for the placebo group and treatment group were 3 (range 0-10) and 2 (range 0,8), respectively (P = .29). There were no significant differences in preinjection pain scores reported before anesthesia and suppository and at 40 minutes after administration of anesthesia and suppository. Postprocedure postvoid residual >200 mL was noted in 5 (38%) of the placebo group and 3 (23%) of the treatment group (P = .67). Two-week postprocedure postvoid residual >200 mL was noted in 3 (25%) of the placebo group and 2 (15%) of the treatment group (P = .64) for an overall rate of 20%. Eleven (84%) participants in each group reported being ""mostly satisfied"" or ""very much satisfied"" with pain control. CONCLUSION: Belladonna and opiate suppository use did not significantly reduce bladder injection pain, or increase risk of urinary retention immediately postprocedure or 2 weeks later. Satisfaction with pain control among onabotulinum toxin A injection patients is high."
29869680	Filgrastim	Febrile Neutropenia	0	0	0	0		Reduced dose pegfilgrastim is associated with less bone pain without increased neutropenia: a retrospective study.	BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy for breast cancer is associated with a high risk of neutropenia. Pegfilgrastim reduces the risk of neutropenic fever but commonly causes bone pain. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate whether a reduced dose of pegfilgrastim (3 mg) reduced the frequency of bone pain without compromising efficacy. METHODS: Records reviewed from breast cancer patients who received at least one 3 mg dose of pegfilgrastim, white blood count (WBC), and absolute granulocyte counts (AGC) were collected. Musculoskeletal pain scale was collected at each visit. RESULTS: 265 treatments from 36 women were analyzed. There was no difference in post-treatment AGC between 3 versus 6 mg. Leukocytosis (WBC > 20,000 cells/cu mm) was more likely for those treated with 6 mg (chi-square 5.265, p = 0.0215). There was higher change in bone pain in patients who received 6 mg doses compared to none or 3 mg. LIMITATIONS: In this retrospective, non-randomized study, we found the majority of patients received the reduced 3 mg dose after intolerance to the 6 mg dose. It is unknown if smaller or larger doses than 3 mg would achieve similar results or whether 3 mg dose would be effective as an initial therapy or for patients receiving different chemotherapy regimens. Pain is observed despite premedication with naproxen and/or loratidine. CONCLUSION: Reduced dose of pegfilgrastim 3 mg was less likely to cause bone pain. The reduced dose was not associated with a significant difference in post-treatment AGC or rate of serious infection.

31073921	Diclofenac	Gastrointestinal Diseases	0	1	0	0		Safety of Oral Non-Selective Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs in Osteoarthritis: What Does the Literature Say?	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely recommended and prescribed to treat pain in osteoarthritis. While measured to have a moderate effect on pain in osteoarthritis, NSAIDs have been associated with wide-ranging adverse events affecting the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Gastrointestinal toxicity is found with all NSAIDs, which may be of particular concern when treating older patients with osteoarthritis, and gastric adverse events may be reduced by taking a concomitant gastroprotective agent, although intestinal adverse events are not ameliorated. Cardiovascular toxicity is associated with all NSAIDs to some extent and the degree of risk appears to be pharmacotherapy specific. An increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure is observed with all NSAIDs, while an elevated risk of hemorrhagic stroke appears to be restricted to the use of diclofenac and meloxicam. All NSAIDs have the potential to induce acute kidney injury, and patients with osteoarthritis with co-morbid conditions including hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus are at increased risk. Osteoarthritis is associated with excess mortality, which may be explained by reduced levels of physical activity owing to lower limb pain, presence of comorbid conditions, and the adverse effects of anti-osteoarthritis medications especially NSAIDs. This narrative review of recent literature identifies data on the safety of non-selective NSAIDs to better understand the risk:benefit of using NSAIDs to manage pain in osteoarthritis.

29853315	Heparin	Thrombocytopenia	1	1	0	0	0.0	The Use of Cangrelor and Heparin for Anticoagulation in a Patient Requiring Pulmonary Thromboendarterectomy Surgery with Suspected Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia.	The management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in the perioperative period for patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) can be a challenging clinical scenario. Once a diagnosis of HIT has been established, heparin products typically are avoided and alternative therapies for anticoagulation are started. Alternative anticoagulation strategies for CPB are limited and often have various pharmacokinetic profiles that may lead to increased perioperative bleeding. Historically the use of a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor, such as tirofiban, followed by unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the typical alternative for surgeries requiring DHCA in patients with HIT at the authors' institution. This article presents a case in which cangrelor followed by UFH was used in a 20-year-old patient with suspected HIT and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy surgery requiring CPB and DHCA. Due to the frequency of significant postoperative bleeding encountered when using tirofiban and UFH, it was decided to attempt to block platelet aggregation with significantly shorter-acting cangrelor. The authors hypothesized that cangrelor would reduce the risk of significant bleeding compared with tirofiban because of its favorable pharmacokinetics. Specifically, cangrelor has a short elimination half-life of 3 to 6 minutes, and its elimination is not altered by renal and hepatic impairment. This case report discusses the pathophysiology of HIT, the alternative anticoagulants used for HIT type II in pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, and the potential of cangrelor in conjunction with UFH to be a favorable option for patients in similar clinical scenarios.
30500483	Carbamazepine	Thyroid Diseases	1	0	0	0		Lipid and thyroid hormone levels in children with epilepsy treated with levetiracetam or carbamazepine: A prospective observational study.	Although previous studies have investigated the influence of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on lipid profiles and thyroid hormone levels, there is little evidence regarding the effects of levetiracetam (LEV). Therefore, we conducted a prospective longitudinal study to evaluate the effects of LEV and carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment on lipid profile and thyroid hormone levels in patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) age between 4 and 15 years, (b) diagnosis of epilepsy with at least two focal seizures within a year, and (c) newly treated with LEV or CBZ monotherapy. Serum lipid profile and thyroid hormone levels were measured before and after 1 and 6 months of AED initiation. Among the 21 included patients (LEV: 13 patients, CBZ: 8 patients), all but one patient in the LEV group continued AED monotherapy during the study period. Although triglyceride (TG) levels tended to be increased in the CBZ group (baseline: 58.3 +/- 22.0 mg/dl, 1 month: 63.8 +/- 21.6 mg/dl, 6 months: 92.3 +/- 63.6 mg/dl, p = 0.22, analyses of variance (ANOVA)), there were no significant changes in total cholesterol (TC), TG levels, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in either group. Serum free thyroxine (fT4) levels were significantly decreased in the CBZ group (baseline: 1.15 +/- 0.06 ng/dl, 1 month: 1.00 +/- 0.16 ng/dl, 6 months: 0.98 +/- 0.14 ng/dl, p = 0.03, ANOVA). In contrast, there were no significant changes in fT4 or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels in the LEV group. The results of the present study suggest that LEV monotherapy does not affect lipid profile or thyroid function while CBZ monotherapy may cause thyroid dysfunction.
30844552	Rituximab	Agammaglobulinemia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Immunoglobulin replacement for secondary immunodeficiency after B-cell targeted therapies in autoimmune rheumatic disease: Systematic literature review.	BACKGROUND: Consensus guidelines are not available for the use of immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT) in patients developing iatrogenic secondary antibody deficiency following B-cell targeted therapy (BCTT) in autoimmune rheumatic disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of IGRT to manage hypogammaglobulinemia following BCTT in autoimmune rheumatic disease (AIRD). METHODS: Using an agreed search string we performed a systematic literature search on Medline with Pubmed as vendor. We limited the search to English language papers with abstracts published over the last 10 years. Abstracts were screened for original data regarding hypogammaglobulinemia following BCTT and the use of IGRT for hypogammaglobulinemia following BCTT. We also searched current recommendations from national/international organisations including British Society for Rheumatology, UK Department of Health, American College of Rheumatology, and American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology. RESULTS: 222 abstracts were identified. Eight papers had original relevant data that met our search criteria. These studies were largely retrospective cohort studies with small patient numbers receiving IGRT. The literature highlights the induction of a sustained antibody deficiency, risk factors for hypogammaglobulinemia after BCTT including low baseline serum IgG levels, how to monitor patients for the development of hypogammaglobulinemia and the limited evidence available on intervention thresholds for commencing IGRT. CONCLUSION: The benefit of BCTT needs to be balanced against the risk of inducing a sustained secondary antibody deficiency. Consensus guidelines would be useful to enable appropriate assessment prior to and following BCTT in preventing and diagnosing hypogammaglobulinemia. Definitions for symptomatic hypogammaglobulinemia, intervention thresholds and treatment targets for IGRT, and its cost-effectiveness are required.

30185146	Propofol	Sleep Apnea, Obstructive	1	0	0	0		Comparison of upper airway patency in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea during dexmedetomidine or propofol sedation: a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: In addition to propofol, dexmedetomidine is a suitable alternative for intraoperative sedation in procedures requiring regional anesthesia. To date, however, little is known about the influences of each drug on upper airway patency. Accordingly, the authors investigated differences between dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation in the occurrence of upper airway obstruction and requirements for airway intervention in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea. METHODS: Patients with an apnea/hypopnea index of 5-14/h according to Watch-PAT 200 analysis were enrolled in this study. Spinal anesthesia was routinely performed for surgery. Intraoperative sedation was initiated using either dexmedetomidine or propofol infusion at a level of modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale 3. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients exhibiting signs of upper airway obstruction. A sign of upper airway obstruction was defined as no detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide for at least 10 s despite respiratory efforts. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included in the final analysis (dexmedetomidine [n = 26]; propofol [n = 24]). During the intraoperative sedation period, there was a significantly lower proportion of patients exhibiting signs of upper airway obstruction in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group (11.5% vs. 41.7%, P = 0.035). An artificial airway was inserted in 1 patients (3.8%) and 5 patient (20.8%) in the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups, respectively (P = 0.093). CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with a lower incidence of upper airway obstruction than propofol sedation in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea.

29607622	Hyaluronic Acid	Ischemia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Ischemic oculomotor nerve palsy due to hyaluronic acid filler injection.	Hyaluronic acid (HA) is the most popular agent today for intradermal injections to improve wrinkles and other cosmetic defects. Ischemic necrosis due to injection of HA is one of the serious complications. Because there are many vascular branches around the nose, caution and care should be given during facial filler injection. Although the incidence is rare, blindness and permanent visual loss may occur. We describe a 29-year-old woman presented with painful erythematous swelling with violaceous patch on right periocular area and glabella after HA filler injection. After injecting the filler, she felt pain and dizziness, and her vision became blurred. She immediately received hyaluronidase around the HA filler inject area and during hospitalized for 10 days, she was successfully treated with systemic steroid, vasodilator, prophylactic antibiotics, and LLLT (low-level laser therapy) without any defects.
29126352	Nivolumab	Myocarditis	1	1	0	1	0.0	Fatal myocarditis and rhabdomyolysis induced by nivolumab during the treatment of type B3 thymoma.	Immune checkpoint inhibitors including programmed death-1 inhibitors are promising agents for many types of malignancies; however, it is still an off-label choice for type B3 thymoma. We reported for the first time a patient with type B3 thymoma developed fatal myocarditis and rhabdomyolysis after one dose of nivolumab administration. The results from myocardial and muscle biopsies revealed extensive myocyte damage, T-lymphocytic infiltration and strongly expression of PD-L1 which confirmed the nivolumab-related immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The blood tests showed elevated levels of serum AChR-binding antibody and inflammatory cytokines, in addition abnormal lymphocyte subsets were noted. Our report suggested that administration of nivolumab in type B3 thymoma could cause rare but fatal myocarditis and rhabdomyolysis, over-expressed AChR-binding antibody and inflammatory cytokines may be potential biomarkers for irAEs.
31096532	Ipilimumab	Exanthema	1	0	0	0		Risk of dermatologic and mucosal adverse events associated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in cancer patients: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	BACKGROUND: Programmed death 1 protein (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors are promising cancer immunotherapy. Their dermatologic safety profiles are still poorly understood. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the incidence of selected dermatologic and mucosal adverse effects (AEs) and determine the risk of developing these adverse events associated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, compared with chemotherapy or ipilimumab. METHODS: PubMed was searched for eligible studies (up to February 21, 2019). Only phase II and phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared with chemotherapy or ipilimumab monotherapy were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total 11,465 patients from 18 clinical trials were included in this meta-analysis. Rash and pruritus were the most frequently reported dermatologic AE, with incidence 11.8% and 12.2% respectively. Compared with patients receiving chemotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treated patients had higher risk of developing rash (RR = 1.84), pruritus (RR = 3.74) and vitiligo (RR = 9.54), and also lower risk in developing mucosal inflammation (RR = 0.26), stomatitis (RR = 0.26), and alopecia (RR = 0.03). Additionally, anti-PD1/PD-L1 drugs had similar risk of developing rash and lower risk of inducing pruritus compared to ipilimumab. In the subgroup analysis, PD-L1 inhibitor demonstrated better safety than PD-1 inhibitor in developing rash, with RR = 1.38 and RR = 2.11, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis concluded that anti PD-1/PD-L1 drugs have different dermatological and mucosal safety profile compared to conventional therapy, and differences of dermatological toxicity between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor warrant further investigation.

29617878	Ethanol	Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects	1	1	0	0	0.0	Role of TGFbeta Signaling in Maternal Ethanol-Induced Fetal Articular Cartilage Dysplasia and Adult Onset of Osteoarthritis in Male Rats.	Based on our previous findings that prenatal ethanol exposure in offspring increased susceptibility to adult osteoarthritis, this study aimed to further investigate the direct toxicity of ethanol on fetal articular cartilage development. Rat bone marrow-derived stroma cells were capsulated in alginate beads, incubated in a chondrogenic differentiation medium, and cultured for 4 weeks with ethanol treatment at concentrations of 0, 4, 20, and 100 mM. Pregnant rats were treated with ethanol (4 g/kg/day) from gestational days (GDs) 9 to 20. At GD20 and postnatal weeks 2, 6, and 12, 8 male offspring were sacrificed, and 8 male offspring rats of 8-weeks old in each group were treated with or without intraarticular injection of papain for 4 weeks to verify the susceptibility of adult osteoarthritis. Ethanol treatment resulted in poor differentiation of bone marrow-derived stroma cells to chondrocytes and suppressed the expression of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta)-smad2/3-Sox9 signaling pathway. In animal experiments, the shape of articular cartilage in the ethanol treatment group was more disordered than that of the control group, the matrix was not deep, and the cartilage was thin, which showed poor cartilage development. The TGFbeta signaling pathway in the ethanol treatment group was persistently low at all time points. After intraarticular injection of papain, histological analyses, and the Mankin score revealed increased cartilage destruction in the ethanol treatment group. Ethanol caused articular cartilage dysplasia that was programmed in adulthood via a low-functional TGFbeta signaling pathway, and the tolerance of this articular cartilage to external stimuli was significantly decreased.
29761242	Benzbromarone	Kidney Calculi	0	0	0	0		Safety and Efficacy of Benzbromarone and Febuxostat in Hyperuricemia Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Prospective Pilot Study.	BACKGROUND: To compare the safety and efficacy of benzbromarone and febuxostat in hyperuricemia patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 20-60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). METHODS: This study was a single-centered, parallel-grouped, randomized clinical trial (RCT). We randomly assigned hyperuricemia participants with eGFR 20-60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) into benzbromarone and febuxostat treatment group. Drugs were adjusted by titration from small doses. RESULTS: Seventy-three eligible participants enrolled, 66 subjects (33 in each group) were included finally for analysis. When compared to baseline, serum uric acid (SUA) decreased significantly after treatment in both groups, but no differences were detected among all the follow-up points. After 12-month treatment, eGFR did not have significant change in both groups. In the benzbromarone group, kidney stones in one case increased in quantity. In the febuxostat group, kidney stones in one case became smaller in size and in two cases vanished completely. Both drugs did not increase myocardial enzymes significantly after the treatment. In addition, hemoglobin increased significantly in the two groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Benzbromarone and febuxostat could reduce SUA and maintain renal function in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with eGFR 20-60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Urate-lowering therapy with benzbromarone or febuxostat could increase serum hemoglobin level and potentially improve anemia.
29396698	Denosumab	Spinal Fractures	1	1	0	0	0.0	Vertebral Fractures Following Denosumab Discontinuation in Patients with Prolonged Exposure to Bisphosphonates.	Denosumab (DMAB) efficacy for treatment of osteoporosis was demonstrated in a pivotal trial with a reduction in vertebral and hip fractures during 3 years, and fracture risk reduction was sustained up to 10 years in an extension study. DMAB causes potent yet reversible inhibition of bone resorption. Bone density declines rapidly upon discontinuation and bone turnover markers increase above baseline in a rebound fashion. Spontaneous multiple vertebral fractures after DMAB discontinuation were recently reported. Prior treatment with bisphosphonates (BP) was postulated to decrease the risk for this alarming phenomenon. We aimed to describe our experience of fractures following DMAB withdrawal with special attention to past history of osteoporosis treatment. A phone survey of physicians engaged in bone metabolism from nine hospitals in Israel was performed. Clinical data of the patients presenting with vertebral fractures upon DMAB discontinuation were summarized and compared to the previously published cases. Nine elderly (74.2 +/- 5.3 years) female patients were identified. Most patients had a prolonged prior exposure to BP (7.4 +/- 3.2 years). All but one sustained osteoporotic fractures prior to DMAB initiation and their FRAX scores were high. Thirty-six vertebral fractures were identified in nine patients. Eight patients presented with multiple fractures, and most fractures were spontaneous. In line with the previous reports, the timing and severity of the fractures raise concern of DMAB discontinuation effect. Prolonged BP exposure in most of our patients challenges the protective effect hypothesis. Care providers, patients, and regulatory authorities should be aware of the possible risk of DMAB treatment interruption.

BACKGROUND: The influence of cangrelor on the incidence and outcomes of post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) thrombocytopenia is not defined. We aimed to explore the incidence, predictors, and clinical impact of thrombocytopenia after PCI in cangrelor-treated patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a pooled, patient-level analysis of the CHAMPION trials (Cangrelor Versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition), which compared cangrelor with clopidogrel for prevention of thrombotic complications during and after PCI. Acquired thrombocytopenia was defined as either a drop in platelet count to <100 000 after PCI or a drop of >50% between baseline and a follow-up. The main efficacy outcome was major adverse cardiac events. The primary safety outcome was noncoronary artery bypass grafting-related Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries-defined severe bleeding at 48 hours. Patients (23 783) were enrolled, and 3009 (12.7%) received a GPI (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor). Acquired thrombocytopenia occurred in 200 patients (0.8%). The adjusted rate of major adverse cardiovascular events at 48 hours was significantly higher in patients who developed thrombocytopenia compared with those who did not (odds ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-4.69; P<0.001), as was major bleeding (odds ratio, 14.71; 95% confidence interval, 5.96-36.30; P<0.001). GPI use was the strongest independent predictor of acquired thrombocytopenia (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% confidence interval, 2.15-3.97; P<0.0001). There was no difference in the rate of acquired thrombocytopenia in patients randomized to cangrelor or clopidogrel. CONCLUSIONS: Acquired thrombocytopenia after PCI is strongly associated with substantial early morbidity and mortality, as well as major bleeding. GPI use is a significant predictor of thrombocytopenia. Cangrelor is not associated with acquired thrombocytopenia, and its clinical efficacy and safety is consistent irrespective of thrombocytopenia occurrence.

30308083	Nivolumab	Thyroiditis	1	1	0	0	0.0	Thyroiditis and immune check point inhibitors: the post-marketing experience using the French National Pharmacovigilance database.	Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for cancer has become increasingly prescribed in recent years. Indeed, it is used to treat both solid and hematological malignancies due to their considerable potential in treating melanoma, non-small cell lung and other cancers. Immune-mediated related adverse endocrine toxicity, and especially thyroiditis, is seen as a growing problem needing specific screening and management. This study aims at describing thyroid dysfunctions induced by the ICIs marketed in France, which are registered in the French Pharmacovigilance database. This database was queried for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab-induced adverse drug reactions reported before April 30, 2017. Both a pharmacologist and an endocrinologist have reviewed each case to select only those of peripheral thyroiditis (thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism). During this period, 110 thyroiditis following ICI therapy were reported. Sex/ratio was around one. Most of the cases (47.2%) were asymptomatic. Although some thyrotoxicosis cases were severe, no orbitopathy was reported. Hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis were equally described. Antithyroid antibodies were positive in only 16% patients. The ultrasonography was informative in 19% patients. Levothyroxine supplementation was necessary in 57% patients, leading to 19% recovery. With a dedicated optimized management, most of the cases did not require immunotherapy discontinuation. Finally, immune-mediated related thyroiditis is increasing due to a wider prescription of ICI therapy in various cancer conditions and systematic screening. Often asymptomatic, they lead to a local activation accompanied by hormonal deficiency in the long run. It is necessary to carry out an early and sustained multidisciplinary screening to allow immunotherapy continuation.
31141632	Dexamethasone	Neutropenia	0	0	0	0		Daratumumab plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for Untreated Myeloma.	BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone is a standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation. We sought to determine whether the addition of daratumumab would significantly reduce the risk of disease progression or death in this population. METHODS: We randomly assigned 737 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation to receive daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (daratumumab group) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (control group). Treatment was to continue until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable side effects. The primary end point was progression-free survival. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 28.0 months, disease progression or death had occurred in 240 patients (97 of 368 patients [26.4%] in the daratumumab group and 143 of 369 patients [38.8%] in the control group). The estimated percentage of patients who were alive without disease progression at 30 months was 70.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.0 to 75.4) in the daratumumab group and 55.6% (95% CI, 49.5 to 61.3) in the control group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.73; P<0.001). The percentage of patients with a complete response or better was 47.6% in the daratumumab group and 24.9% in the control group (P<0.001). A total of 24.2% of the patients in the daratumumab group, as compared with 7.3% of the patients in the control group, had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease (1 tumor cell per 10(5) white cells) (P<0.001). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (50.0% in the daratumumab group vs. 35.3% in the control group), anemia (11.8% vs. 19.7%), lymphopenia (15.1% vs. 10.7%), and pneumonia (13.7% vs. 7.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were ineligible for autologous stem-cell transplantation, the risk of disease progression or death was significantly lower among those who received daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone than among those who received lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. A higher incidence of neutropenia and pneumonia was observed in the daratumumab group. (Funded by Janssen Research and Development; MAIA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02252172.).
31037185	Tamoxifen	Pancytopenia	0	1	0	1		A diffuse large B cell lymphoma emerging with breast cancer relapse.	The prevalence of secondary cancers associated with the breast cancer treatment has increased, which is due to the administration of cytotoxic/hormonal drugs as well as radiotherapy. A 54-year-old female patient with a history of breast cancer for 4 years and receiving tamoxifen the hematology clinic with fatigue and nosebleed. Laboratory parameters were revealed pancytopenia. The bone marrow biopsy finding was compatible with CD20 positive high-grade B cell lymphoma resembling diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The patient started to receive a chemotherapy. Her hemogram values displayed an improvement after the second cycle. However, interim PET-BT, performed after the fourth cycle, showed an incomplete response in cervical lymphatic nodes. Then, a tru-cut biopsy was performed resulting in breast cancer metastasis. This is an unusual case of secondary-DLBCL presenting with pancytopenia and occuring 4 years after the diagnosis of breast cancer. In conclusion, clinicians should carefully set the dosage of chemotherapy drugs to avoid the long-term side effects associated with such drugs.
30576386	Ribavirin	Dyslipidemias	0	0	0	0		Liver steatosis and dyslipidemia after HCV eradication by direct acting antiviral agents are synergistic risks of atherosclerosis.	AIM: We comprehensively analyzed how hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication by interferon (IFN)-free direct-acting-antiviral-agents (DAAs) affects liver steatosis and atherogenic risk. METHODS: Patients treated with IFN-free-DAAs who underwent transient elastography before and at 24-weeks post-treatment, including controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), and achieved sustained viral response (SVR) were enrolled. The association between changes in liver steatosis, lipid-metabolism, and genetic and clinical factors was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included. The mean CAP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly elevated at SVR24. However, baseline LDL-C and CAP values were significantly negatively correlated with changes in these values after HCV eradication, indicating that in patients with high baseline values, the values generally decreased after HCV eradication. Mean small-dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), which has greater atherogenic potential, was significantly elevated only in patients with both dyslipidemia (LDL-C >140 mg/dL) and liver steatosis (CAP >248 dB/m) at SVR24. Those patients had significant higher baseline BMI, LDL-C, and total-cholesterol levels. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, successful HCV eradication by IFN-free-DAAs decreases CAP and LDL-C in patients with high baseline values. However, elevated LDL-C was accompanied with elevated sdLDL-C only in patients with liver steatosis and dyslipidemia at SVR24; therefore, those patients may require closer monitoring.

30045957	Human Growth Hormone	Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome	1	1	0	0	0.0	Susceptibility to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after human growth hormone treatment in France.	OBJECTIVE: To identify, among the available data concerning host characteristics and exposure, risk factors influencing the susceptibility for developing iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD) in a cohort of patients treated with human cadaver-sourced growth hormone (hGH) in France. METHODS: This study included all 1,443 individuals treated in France with hGH from January 1982 to December 1985, out of which 119 cases of hGH-iCJD have been identified so far. We applied a 3 sequential step Cox analysis involving univariable, stepwise, and nonstepwise multivariable procedures. The variables studied were sex, age at hGH treatment initiation, and treatment characteristics (batches and doses). RESULTS: While no effect of age at treatment initiation was observed, a significant effect of sex on disease susceptibility was unexpectedly evidenced with a 2-fold increase of disease occurrence in male patients. This effect did not depend on differences of exposure between male and female patients. We identified 4 categories of hormone batches from high risk to no association with susceptibility. A relationship between the dose received from at-risk hormone batches and the attack rate (number of patients developing the disease among exposed individuals) was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Studying the hGH-exposed patients in France provides epidemiologic evidence of a relationship between dose of inoculum and disease occurrence in humans and suggests an unexpected effect of sex on individual susceptibility.
30658314	Methotrexate	Multiple Myeloma	1	1	1	1	1.0	Highly aggressive plasmablastic neoplasms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate.	Patients with rheumatoid arthritis occasionally develop lymphoproliferative disorders. Methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders is a lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma in patients treated with methotrexate for autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Here we report two rare cases of highly aggressive plasmablastic lymphoproliferative disorders in rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate. Case 1 is a 68-year-old female patient with leukemic transformation of malignant lymphoma. She received methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis for >6 years. The patient showed rapid progressive course and died on the 2nd hospital day. After the death, we diagnosed the patient as plasmablastic lymphoma. Case 2 is an 80-year-old female patient with plasmablastic plasma cell myeloma, with a history of methotrexate treatment for rheumatoid arthritis for >5 years. Although M-protein was decreased by chemotherapy, bone marrow examination revealed the further increase of plasmablastic cells and she died 2 months later. The present cases were difficult to diagnose because proliferation of malignant plasmablasts was hardly predicted because neither lymph node enlargement nor an evident M-protein was observed. Both cases showed aggressive features and extremely poor prognosis. Clinicians should be aware of the underlying malignant plasmablastic proliferation when inexplicable inflammatory findings are observed in inactive rheumatoid arthritis patients.

BACKGROUND: This phase Ib study (NCT00960960) evaluated pictilisib (GDC-0941; pan-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) plus paclitaxel, with and without bevacizumab or trastuzumab, or in combination with letrozole, in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: This was a three-part multischedule study. Patients in parts 1 and 2, which comprised 3 + 3 dose escalation and cohort expansion stages, received pictilisib (60-330 mg) plus paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) with and without bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) or trastuzumab (2-4 mg/kg). In part 3, patients received pictilisib (260 mg) plus letrozole (2.5 mg). Primary objectives were evaluation of safety and tolerability, identification of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pictilisib, and recommendation of a phase II dosing regimen. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled; all experienced at least one adverse event (AE). Grade >/= 3 AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to death were reported in 50 (72.5%), 21 (30.4%), and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively. Six (8.7%) patients reported a DLT, and the MTD and recommended phase II pictilisib doses were established where possible. There was no pictilisib-paclitaxel drug-drug interaction. Two (3.4%) patients experienced complete responses, and 17 (29.3%) patients had partial responses. CONCLUSIONS: Combining pictilisib with paclitaxel, with and without bevacizumab or trastuzumab, or letrozole, had a manageable safety profile in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The combination had antitumor activity, and the additive effect of pictilisib supported further investigation in a randomized study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00960960 .

BACKGROUND: This phase Ib study (NCT00960960) evaluated pictilisib (GDC-0941; pan-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) plus paclitaxel, with and without bevacizumab or trastuzumab, or in combination with letrozole, in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: This was a three-part multischedule study. Patients in parts 1 and 2, which comprised 3 + 3 dose escalation and cohort expansion stages, received pictilisib (60-330 mg) plus paclitaxel (90 mg/m(2)) with and without bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) or trastuzumab (2-4 mg/kg). In part 3, patients received pictilisib (260 mg) plus letrozole (2.5 mg). Primary objectives were evaluation of safety and tolerability, identification of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pictilisib, and recommendation of a phase II dosing regimen. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled; all experienced at least one adverse event (AE). Grade >/= 3 AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to death were reported in 50 (72.5%), 21 (30.4%), and 2 (2.9%) patients, respectively. Six (8.7%) patients reported a DLT, and the MTD and recommended phase II pictilisib doses were established where possible. There was no pictilisib-paclitaxel drug-drug interaction. Two (3.4%) patients experienced complete responses, and 17 (29.3%) patients had partial responses. CONCLUSIONS: Combining pictilisib with paclitaxel, with and without bevacizumab or trastuzumab, or letrozole, had a manageable safety profile in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The combination had antitumor activity, and the additive effect of pictilisib supported further investigation in a randomized study. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00960960 .

29185821	Ethanol	Cognitive Dysfunction	1	1	0	0	0.0	Neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental impact of prenatal methamphetamine exposure: A comparison study of prenatally exposed children with nonexposed ADHD peers.	Prenatal methamphetamine exposure has become an increasingly pervasive concern, especially in rural-based populations and populations of lower socioeconomic status. While research has begun to highlight the effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure, the long-term impact of this exposure remains an under-investigated topic. This study attempts to investigate the neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure by comparing the index and full-scale IQ scores on the WISC-IV between a sample of clinically referred children prenatally exposed to methamphetamine (N = 80) and a sample of clinically referred nonexposed children diagnosed with ADHD (N = 44). Children prenatally exposed to methamphetamine showed significantly lower scores on all WISC-IV domains when compared to peers with ADHD. When taking into account polysubstance exposure to alcohol, these differences remained statistically significant, with the exception of the Processing Speed Index (PSI); children reported to have been prenatally exposed to methamphetamine and to alcohol (PME) remained below ADHD peers on all other WISC-IV index scores. Within the prenatally exposed sample, regression analyses indicated that age was a significant negative predictor of PSI scores. Overall findings suggest that prenatal methamphetamine exposure is associated with a notable cognitive impact independent of polysubstance exposure to alcohol, and that the impact of this exposure on processing speed skills may become more pronounced with age.

28718886	Gentamicins	Hearing Loss	0	1	0	0		Brainstem auditory evoked responses in 37 dogs with otitis media before and after topical therapy.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether intra-aural administration of aqueous solutions of marbofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin and ticarcillin (used off-licence) was associated with changes in hearing as measured by brainstem auditory evoked responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dogs diagnosed with otitis media (n=37) underwent brainstem auditory evoked response testing and then were treated for their ear disease. First, the external ear canal and middle ear were flushed with sterile saline followed by EDTA tris with 0.15% chlorhexidine. Then, a combination of aqueous antibiotic mixed with an aqueous solution of EDTA tris was instilled into the middle ear. Follow-up examinations were undertaken for each dog, and treatment was continued until there were no detected infectious organisms or inflammatory infiltrate. Brainstem auditory evoked response testing was repeated after resolution of the infection and discontinuation of therapy. RESULTS: Brainstem auditory evoked responses in dogs treated with aqueous solutions of marbofloxacin or gentamicin remained unchanged or improved after therapy of otitis media but were impaired in dogs treated with ticarcillin or tobramycin. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: If off-licence use of topical antibiotics is deemed necessary in cases of otitis media, aqueous solutions of marbofloxacin and gentamicin appear to be less ototoxic than aqueous solutions of ticarcillin or tobramycin.

30025517	Neostigmine	Postoperative Complications	1	1	0	0	0.0	Postoperative complications with neuromuscular blocking drugs and/or reversal agents in obstructive sleep apnea patients: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBD) are administered intra-operatively to facilitate intubation and to achieve muscle relaxation for surgical procedures. Incomplete reversal of NMBD can lead to adverse events in the postoperative period. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be at higher risk of complications related to the use of NMBD. The objectives of this systematic review were to determine whether: 1) OSA patients are at higher risk of postoperative complications from the use of NMBD than non-OSA patients, and 2) the choice of NMBD reversal agent affects the risk of postoperative complications in OSA patients. METHODS: A literature search of multiple databases was conducted up to April 2017. The inclusion criteria were: (1) adult surgical patients (>/=18 years old) with OSA diagnosed by polysomnography, or history, or suspected by screening questionnaire; (2) patients who were given NMBD and/or NMBD reversal agents intraoperatively; (3) reports on postoperative adverse events, particularly respiratory events were available; (4) published studies were in English; and (5) RCTs or observational cohort studies. The quality of evidence was determined by the Oxford Center for Evidence Based Medicine levels of evidence. RESULTS: Out of 4123 studies, five studies (2 RCTs and 3 observational studies) including 1126 patients were deemed eligible. These studies were heterogeneous precluding a meta-analysis of the results. Two of three studies (1 RCT, 2 observational studies) reported that OSA patients given NMBD may be at higher risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) like hypoxemia, residual neuromuscular blockade or respiratory failure compared to non-OSA patients. Two studies (1 RCT, 1 observational study) reported that OSA patients who were reversed with sugammadex vs. neostigmine had less PPCs and chest radiographic changes, but the quality of the included studies was Oxford level of evidence: low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: OSA patients who receive intraoperative NMBD may be at higher risk for postoperative hypoxemia, respiratory failure and residual neuromuscular blockade compared to non-OSA patients. There is some, albeit very limited evidence that NMBD reversal with sugammadex may be associated with less PPCs than neostigmine in patients with OSA. More high-quality studies are needed.

After exclusion of an inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic origin, a thorough personal history revealed that for many years the patient had been using analgesic suppositories containing indomethacin, caffeine, and prochlorperazine dimaleate, four to five times a week, for migraine. On stopping the suppositories, there was complete healing within 12 weeks. We hypothesize that vasoconstriction and vascular damage were the pathogenetic mechanisms behind the perianal ulcers.
30234413	Nitrous Oxide	Spinal Cord Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Imaging appearance of myelopathy secondary to nitrous oxide abuse: a case report and review of the literature.	Purpose The abuse of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) can induce Vitamin B(12) deficiency that subsequently leads to central nervous demyelination, myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Although myelopathy has been reported in the past, the specific locations and prognosis of the disease are still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the case of a 22-year-old male who presented with quadriplegia that began after a 3-month history of inhalation of N(2)O. We summarized the clinical data of this entity and performed a comprehensive literature review of various presentations and MRI features of myelopathy secondary to N(2)O abuse. RESULTS: In combination with previous reports of 14 cases, we found that the onset of the disease was usually subacute, and the majority of patients (92.85%) were young men. There was no definite relationship between myelopathy and the amount or duration of N(2)O inhalation. The most common clinical manifestation was sensory ataxia, and the cervical spinal cord was the most frequently impaired area of the whole spinal cord. The spinal cord lesions had a high signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI and usually involved more than three spinal segments and impaired the posterior column more significantly. Most patients recovered well after vitamin B(12) supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Myelopathy secondary to N(2)O abuse is generally seen in young men. The clinical diagnosis mainly depends on a history of N(2)O inhalation and the characteristic imaging changes in the posterior cervical spinal cord. Early diagnosis and intervention are important for a satisfactory prognosis.

Fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from Isostichopus badionotus (fCS-Ib) is a kind of sulfated polysaccharides with well-repeated structure. In our former publications, fCS-Ib has been reported to be a functional food ingredient with hypoglycemic and antilipemic activities. However, there is no systematic study to investigate the effects of fCS-Ib on metabolic syndromes. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice fed on a high-fat and high sucrose diet (HFSD) for 6 weeks was used to cause metabolic syndromes. The final results showed that fCS-Ib alleviated obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, inflammation, liver steatosis, and adipocyte hypertrophy caused by HFSD. Meanwhile, fCS-Ib showed powerful effects on moderating gut microbiota dysbiosis in the HFSD-fed mice. Supplement of fCS-Ib could reduce ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes by decreasing abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Allobaculum while increasing abundance of Porphyromonadaceae, Barnesiella, and Bacteroides. Our results showed that fCS-Ib could be further developed as a potential pharmaceutical agent to prevent metabolic syndromes and gut microbiota dysbiosis.

30181173	Lenalidomide	Neutropenia	0	0	0	0		Five-year follow-up of lenalidomide plus rituximab as initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma.	We report 5-year follow-up of a multicenter phase 2 study of lenalidomide plus rituximab (LR) as initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The regimen includes induction and maintenance with the LR doublet. Treatment was continuous until progression, with optional discontinuation after 3 years. The median age of the 38 participants was 65 years, with MCL international prognostic index scores balanced among low, intermediate, and high risk (34%, 34%, and 32%, respectively). Twenty-seven (75%) of the 36 evaluable patients completed >/=3 years of study treatment. At a median follow-up of 64 months (range, 21-78), the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 80% and 90%, respectively, with 5-year estimated PFS and OS of 64% and 77%, respectively. During maintenance, hematologic adverse events (AEs) included asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (42% neutropenia, 5% thrombocytopenia, 3% anemia) and mostly grade 1 or 2 infections managed in the outpatient setting (45% upper respiratory infection, 21% urinary tract infection, 13% sinusitis, 11% cellulitis, 8% pneumonia). Nonhematologic AEs, such as constitutional and inflammatory symptoms, occurred at reduced frequency and intensity compared with induction. A peripheral blood minimal residual disease (MRD) assay (clonoSEQ) showed MRD-negative complete remission in 8 of 10 subjects who had completed >/=3 years of treatment and with available samples for analysis. With longer follow-up, LR continues to demonstrate durable responses and manageable safety as initial induction and maintenance therapy for MCL (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01472562).

We report 5-year follow-up of a multicenter phase 2 study of lenalidomide plus rituximab (LR) as initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The regimen includes induction and maintenance with the LR doublet. Treatment was continuous until progression, with optional discontinuation after 3 years. The median age of the 38 participants was 65 years, with MCL international prognostic index scores balanced among low, intermediate, and high risk (34%, 34%, and 32%, respectively). Twenty-seven (75%) of the 36 evaluable patients completed >/=3 years of study treatment. At a median follow-up of 64 months (range, 21-78), the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 80% and 90%, respectively, with 5-year estimated PFS and OS of 64% and 77%, respectively.

29960004	Finasteride	Gynecomastia	1	1	0	0	0.0	A Review of the FAERS Data on 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors: Implications for Postfinasteride Syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To quantify reports made to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), create a demographic of patient reports, and examine the cluster of symptoms to correlate consistency of postfinasteride syndrome (PFS) complaints. PFS is a provisional diagnosis encompassing a cluster of sexual, physical, and psychological and/or neurologic symptoms associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use that emerge or continue after discontinuation of medication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FAERS dataset of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors from April 2011 to October 2014 was obtained. Each FAERS report had 16 categories for completion, but not every report was fully completed. Statistical analysis compared variables of interest between the 2 doses of finasteride (1 mg vs 5 mg). RESULTS: From FAERS, 2048 monotherapy cases were identified: 1581 of finasteride 1 mg, 240 of finasteride 5 mg, and 226 of unreported doses. Possibly related to labeling changes, from 2011 to 2014, there was a significant increase in adverse events (AEs) reported involving 1 mg dosing. Finasteride use was reported with many sexual AEs including diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory complaints. Other common AEs included dermatologic, metabolic, and psychological and/or neurologic complaints. There were more AE reports with the 1 mg dose than the 5 mg dose. One case of dutasteride reported back pain, not generally attributed to PFS. CONCLUSION: FAERS data suggests that finasteride exposure is reported with a diverse collection of symptoms, particularly in younger men on 1 mg dosage compared to older men on 5 mg. Many of these complaints fall well out of the realm of previously established AEs from long-term controlled studies.

29036361	Docetaxel	Peripheral Nervous System Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Chronic Pain and Neuropathy Following Adjuvant Chemotherapy.	OBJECTIVE: To determine symptoms and characteristics of chronic sensory neuropathy in patients treated with oxaliplatin and docetaxel, including patterns of somatosensory abnormalities, pain descriptors, and psychological functioning. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: A chronic pain research center. SUBJECTS: Thirty-eight patients with chronic peripheral pain and/or dysesthesia following chemotherapy. METHODS: Sensory profiles, psychological functioning, and quality of life were assessed using standardized questionnaires. In addition, standardized quantitative sensory testing and nerve conduction studies were carried out. RESULTS: The sensory profiles and clinical symptoms were very similar in the two groups. Pricking, numbness, and burning were common descriptors in both groups, and the predominant finding was sensory loss to A beta-mediated sensory modalities with decreased mechanical and vibration detection thresholds. A high frequency of abnormalities in thermal sensory limen and the presence of paradoxical heat sensation seem to be sensitive markers of small fiber loss. Both groups had mainly sensory, axonal large fiber or mixed fiber polyneuropathy, which tended to be most severe in the oxaliplatin group. CONCLUSIONS: Both oxaliplatin-induced and docetaxel-induced polyneuropathies represent a significant problem that affects the daily life of the patients. Our results, defining the somatosensory phenotype, can improve the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms useful for future studies in the tailored treatment of prevention of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and pain.

This drug is considered relatively safe with a very low incidence of serious side effects. Common side effects are diarrhea, nausea, headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections which are mild to moderate in severity. Diarrhea tends to occur within 2 weeks of starting treatment and resolve spontaneously within 4 weeks without dose adjustment or discontinuation of therapy. Chronic diarrhea and malnutrition due to apremilast have not been reported yet. We report a case of apremilast induced chronic diarrhea leading to malnutrition, necessitating discontinuation of therapy.

OBJECTIVE: The poor compliance to treatment of Helicobacter pylori-infected patients is well-known. We evaluated the efficacy of daily single-dose triple therapy as compared to conventional triple therapy on patient compliance and eradication of H. pylori infection. METHODS: In the study group, 105 patients received esomeprazole 40 mg, tinidazole 1 g, and levofloxacin 500 mg once-daily for 14 days. One hundred and seven patients in the control group received lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice-daily for 14 days. Four weeks after completing therapy, urea breath test was performed to assess the eradication of H. pylori infection. RESULTS: The eradication rates by intention-to-treat analysis were 86% and 90.2% and by per-protocol analyses were 90.5% and 95.3% in the control and study groups, respectively, with no significant differences. Drug compliance was significantly better in the study group compared to the control group (p = 0.04). Overall, 44.7% of the patients in the study and 47.6% in the control groups had at least one adverse event. The most common adverse event was the dysgeusia in both the groups. The occurrence of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting was significantly higher in the control group and that of arthralgia was higher in the study group. The presence of periodontal disease and drug compliance was independently associated with treatment failure. CONCLUSION: The use of single-dose PPI-based triple therapy improves drug compliance and eradication rate to standard PPI-based triple therapy. Presence of periodontal disease and drug compliance had negative influence on the eradication rate. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02711176 ᅟ ᅟ.
30021507	Lidocaine	Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting	1	0	0	0		Factors associated with intravenous lidocaine in pediatric patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy - a retrospective, single-centre experience.	BACKGROUND: Due to its potential beneficial effects, intra- and postoperative application of intravenous lidocaine has become increasingly accepted over the last couple of years, e.g. in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgical procedures. Based on its beneficial properties, lidocaine was introduced to the standard of care for all pediatric laparoscopic procedures in our institution in mid-2016. In contrast to adult care, scarce data is available regarding the use of perioperative intravenous lidocaine administration in children undergoing laparoscopic procedures, such as an appendectomy. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all pediatric patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy at the University Children's Hospital Zurich in 2016. Perioperative data, as recorded in the electronic patient data management system, were evaluated for any signs of systemic lidocaine toxicity (neurological and cardiovascular), behavioral deterioration, as well as for hemodynamic instability. Additionally, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, administration of pain rescue medication, time to hospital discharge and to first bowel movement, as well as any postoperative complications were recorded. Starting on 01/07/2016, all patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery received intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg body weight (BW) bolus after induction of anesthesia followed by continuous infusion of 1.5 mg/kgBW/h). These patients were then compared to children without lidocaine administration who had undergone laparoscopic appendectomy between 01/01/2016 and 30/06/2016. RESULTS: Data of 116 patients was analyzed. Of these, 60 patients received lidocaine. No signs of systemic toxicity, neurologic impairment or circulatory disturbances were noted in any of these patients. A (non-significant) difference in the incidence of emergence delirium was observed (0 cases in the lidocaine group vs. 4 cases in the control group, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis did not reveal any adverse effects in pediatric patients receiving intravenous lidocaine for laparoscopic appendectomy under general anesthesia. However, further trials investigating beneficial effects as well as pharmacokinetic properties of intravenous lidocaine in children are required.

"PURPOSE: Peripheral sensory neuropathy is the most prominently reported adverse effect of oxaliplatin. The purpose of this study was to evaluate metformin role in oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From November 2014 to May 2016, 40 patients with stage III colorectal cancer completed 12 cycles of FOLFOX-4 regimen. Twenty patients in the control arm received FOLFOX-4 regimen only, and 20 patients in the metformin arm, received the same regimen along with metformin 500 mg three times daily. The metformin efficacy was evaluated using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version 4.0), a12-item neurotoxicity questionnaire (Ntx-12) from the validated Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group and, the brief pain inventory short form ""worst pain"" item. In addition to neurotensin, malondialdehyde and interleukin-6 serum levels assessment. RESULTS: At the end of the 12th cycle, there were less patients with grade 2 and 3 neuropathy in metformin arm as compared to control arm. (60 versus 95%, P = 0.009) In addition, metformin arm showed significantly higher total scores of Ntx-12 questionnaire than control arm (24.0 versus 19.2, P < 0.001). Furthermore, the mean pain score in metformin arm was significantly lower than those of control arm, (6.7 versus 7.3, P = 0.005). Mean serum levels of malondialdehyde and neurotensin were significantly lower in metformin arm after the 6th and the 12th cycles. CONCLUSION: Metformin may be a promising drug in protecting colorectal cancer patients against oxaliplatin-induced chronic peripheral sensory neuropathy."

29945748	Toluene	Cerebellar Diseases	1	1	0	0	0.0	Cerebellar infarction following accidental inhalation of toluene-mixed paint.	We report a case of atypical cerebellar infarction following accidental inhalation of toluene mixed paint. An unconscious 57-year-old housewife with hypertension arrived at our emergency department by ambulance. She had been rescued from a basement (30 m(3)) 12 h after exposure to paint containing toluene (34%). On arrival, she was comatose (E(1)V(1)M(1)) with a mild fever (37.4  degrees C). Physical examination showed chemical burns on her buttocks and rales on the left lung. Initial arterial blood gas with 15 L/min of oxygen showed a pH of 7.142, PCO(2) of 47.3 mmHg, and PaO(2) of 204.7 mmHg. She received endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Laboratory tests showed elevated white blood cells (26.86 x 10(9)/L), C-reactive protein (0.18 mg/dL), glucose (238 mg/Dl), and CPK (1389 U/L). At 5.5 h after arrival, she became responsive to verbal commands. On day 3, after removal of the endotracheal tube, she began to complain of an occipital headache without neurologic abnormalities. Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) performed on day 6 showed a tiny acute infarction on the right cerebellar hemisphere. We serially measured urinary hippuric acid concentrations (reference range, </=2.5 g/g creatinine) from 74 h (3.88) after hospital arrival to 218 h (0.5). She was discharged on day 14. Herein we presented a near fatal toluene intoxication (>45,000 mg/m(3) estimated based on the basement volume and quantity of paint used) with atypical cerebellar infarction, compared with prior findings of bilateral involvement or reversibility.

The first patient had been given an oral diet but was restricted with regard to calorie and sugar intake. The second patient had been nil per os since the operation.
29345686	Arginine	Hemorrhage	1	1	0	0	0.0	Reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.	The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) include dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin, and apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, which inhibit coagulation factor Xa. Although clinical studies of NOACs were conducted without antidotes, patient outcomes with major bleeding when receiving NOACs were no worse than those in patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist. Nonetheless, in patients with life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery, the capacity for rapid NOAC reversal is likely to increase patient safety. Three NOAC reversal agents are in various stages of development: idarucizumab, a specific reversal agent for dabigatran; andexanet alfa, which reverses factor Xa inhibitors; and ciraparantag, which is purported to reverse all NOACs. Idarucizumab is licensed in many countries, andexanet is under consideration by regulatory agencies, and ciraparantag is undergoing phase III evaluation. In the absence of licensed reversal agents for the oral factor Xa inhibitors, prothrombin complex concentrates are often used in patients taking these agents who present with life-threatening bleeding. In this Review, we summarize the approved indications for the NOACs, outline how to measure their anticoagulant effects, describe the mechanism of action of the reversal strategies, assess the preclinical and clinical data supporting their use, provide guidance on potential indications for reversal, and offer a management approach for patients treated with NOACs who present with serious bleeding or require urgent surgery.
29570969	Aripiprazole	Tardive Dyskinesia	1	1	0	0	0.0	Tardive Dyskinesia: Recognition, Patient Assessment, and Differential Diagnosis.	Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an involuntary movement disorder associated with antipsychotic treatment. Because of the serious and potentially irreversible nature of TD, accurate diagnosis is crucial. However, diagnosing TD can be challenging, since the subtle and often fluctuating symptoms can be easily mistaken for symptoms of mental illness or other side effects. Although the risk of developing TD in relation to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics is lower than that associated with first-generation antipsychotics, the risk still exists and may be greater than once believed. Clinicians prescribe antipsychotics for a variety of illnesses and may underestimate the possibility of a patient developing TD, thus missing early signs of the disorder. In this ACADEMIC HIGHLIGHTS, experts review the prevalence, phenomenology, risk factors, and impact of TD, illustrated by case examples, and provide valuable clinical information to guide early recognition and accurate diagnosis.
29681563	Rivaroxaban	Hemorrhage	1	1	1	1	1.0	Prothrombin complex concentrate and fatal thrombotic adverse events: A complication to keep in mind.	Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are well-known complications that can occur after prothrombin complex concentrate therapy. However, acute myocardial infarction is a very rare but potentially life-threatening complication that was exclusively described in patients with bleeding disorders who received chronic and recurrent concentrate infusions. We report the case of a 70 year-old male patient with cholangiocarcinoma who was admitted to our hospital with worsening fatigue and weakness. His stay was complicated by uncontrolled bleeding secondary to rivaroxaban use and advanced liver disease. By the end of the prothrombin complex concentrate infusion used to reverse his coagulopathy, patient developed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock and passed away. This is the first reported case of acute myocardial infarction that occurs in a patient without hemophilia and after the first prothrombin complex concentrate infusion.
30998433	Testosterone	Cardiovascular Diseases	1	0	0	0		An update on heart disease risk associated with testosterone boosting medications.	INTRODUCTION: The cardiovascular (CV) safety of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) remains a crucial issue in the management of subjects with late-onset hypogonadism. The authors systematically reviewed and discussed the available evidence focusing our analysis on heart-related issues. AREAS COVERED: All the available data from prospective observational studies evaluating the role endogenous T levels on the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were collected and analyzed. In addition, the impact of TRT on heart-related diseases, as derived from pharmaco-epidemiological studies as well as from randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs), was also investigated. EXPERT OPINION: Available evidence indicates that endogenous low T represents a risk factor of AMI incidence and its related mortality. TRT in hypogonadal patients is able to improve angina symptoms in subjects with ischemic heart diseases and exercise ability in patients with heart failure (HF). In addition, when prescribed according to the recommended dosage, TRT does not increase the risk of heart-related events.

30689189	Phenobarbital	Exanthema	1	1	0	0	0.0	Adverse Cutaneous Drug Reactions Associated with Old- and New- Generation Antiepileptic Drugs Using the Japanese Pharmacovigilance Database.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adverse cutaneous drug reactions associated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are a serious problem in the clinical setting. New-generation AEDs have been reported to be better tolerated than old-generation forms; however, information about the risks of adverse cutaneous drug reactions to new-generation AEDs is limited. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to clarify the association of AEDs with adverse cutaneous drug reactions using a spontaneous reporting database. METHODS: We performed a retrospective pharmacovigilance disproportionality analysis using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Adverse event reports submitted to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency between April 2004 and January 2017 were analyzed. Based on reports of all adverse events, we obtained 4805 reports of adverse cutaneous drug reactions associated with AEDs, and calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for drug rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). RESULTS: Individual AEDs had variable signals for drug rash, SJS, and TEN. The strongest signals were detected for drug rash caused by lamotrigine (ROR 9.18, 95% CI 8.65-9.74), SJS caused by zonisamide (ROR 9.85, 95% CI 8.23-11.78), and TEN caused by phenobarbital (ROR 14.08, 95% CI 11.28-17.57). CONCLUSION: There are clear differences in the risk of cutaneous reactions among AEDs, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

OBJECTIVES: While several monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are classified as definite or possible carcinogens to humans, little data exist on their role in prostate cancer (PCa). We examined occupational exposure to benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) and styrene and PCa risk in a population-based case-control study in Montreal, Canada. METHODS: Cases aged </=75 years diagnosed with PCa in 2005-2009 (n=1920) and population controls frequency-matched on age (n=1989) provided detailed work histories. Experts evaluated the certainty, frequency and concentration of exposure to monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in each job lasting >/=2 years. Logistic regression estimated OR and 95% CIs for PCa risk, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Exposures to BTX were highly intercorrelated, except for durations of exposure at substantial levels. Ever exposure to any BTX was associated with overall PCa (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.53), while the OR for styrene was 1.19. However, increases in risk were largely confined to low-grade tumours, with ORs of 1.33 (95%CI 1.08 to 1.64) and 1.41 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.31) for ever exposure to any BTX and styrene, respectively, and a duration response pattern for any BTX. Risks for low-grade tumours were elevated among men exposed >/=25 years at substantial levels of benzene (OR 2.32) and styrene (OR 2.44). Some cumulative exposure categories showed increased risks but without clear trends. CONCLUSION: Exposure to any BTX was associated with higher risks of overall PCa. Prolonged exposures at the substantial level to benzene and styrene increased risks of low-grade tumours. These novel findings were independent from PCa screening.

29745067	Propofol	Inflammation	0	0	0	0		Surgery for triple-negative breast cancer- does the type of anaesthesia have an influence on oxidative stress, inflammation, molecular regulators, and outcomes of disease?	Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in females. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a molecular subtype of breast cancer which has a high mortality rate because of aggressive proliferation, quick occurrence of metastasis, and lack of effective treatment. New data show evidence that the type of anaesthesia can affect breast cancer recurrence and long-term outcome. Because TNBC lacks targets for modern specific therapy, a perioperative period could be the field of investigations for the long-term outcomes in TNBC influence. We reviewed the literature on research focusing on the influence of anaesthetics to oxidative stress, inflammation, molecular regulators, and TNBC oncological outcomes.

Anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs are frequently preferred in the treatment of rheumatologic diseases and other inflammatory diseases. The development of myositis after using anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs is a rare clinical condition. Here we aimed to report cases who developed myositis after using anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs and review the current literature. We report two cases of rheumatoid arthritis and a case of ankylosing spondylitis developed idiopathic inflammatory myopathy following anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. In conclusion, myositis could develop during anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy, so these patients should be evaluated carefully initially for myositis and should be closely monitored due to the potential for developing myositis in treatment process.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect afflicting cancer patients treated with oxalipatin based chemotherapy. AIM: The study investigated the potential prophylactic effect of L-carnosine against acute oxaliplatin neurotoxicity in colorectal cancer patients with emphasis on the redox (Nrf-2, MDA), inflammatory (NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha), and apoptotic (caspase-3) parameters. METHODS: In this pilot study, 65 patients were recruited using a prospective randomized controlled study design and enrolled randomly into two arms; Arm A, 31 patients received FOLFOX-6 regimen (oxaliplatin, 5FU & leucovorin) and Arm B, 34 patients received FOLFOX-6 regimen and daily oral L-carnosine (500 mg) along the treatment period. Patients were followed up for three months, then both arms were analyzed for neuropathy incidence/grade and any additional toxicities according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTC version 4). RESULTS: The neuropathy grading evaluation of Arm B vs Arm A revealed that 17 patients (56.7%) vs 11 patients (35.5%) suffered grade 1, one patient (3.3%) vs 19 patients (61.3%) suffered grade 2, while 12 patients (40%) vs one patient (3.2%) were normal. In arm B, the addition of L-carnosine decreased significantly the levels/activity of NF-kappaB (27%) and TNF-alpha (36.6%); this anti-inflammatory effect entailed also its anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects, thus MDA level (51.8%) and caspase-3 activity (49%) were also reduced, whereas Nrf-2 was increased (38.7%) as compared to Arm A. In both arms a significant correlation was only evident between TNF-alpha and the neuropathy grading score (P < .03); the correlation analysis was significantly positive between NF-kappaB and both Nrf-2 and caspase 3. CONCLUSION: L-Carnosine exerted a neuroprotective effect against oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in colorectal cancer patients by targeting Nrf-2 and NF-kappaB pathways.

30656463	Carboplatin	Neutropenia	0	0	0	0		Safety and efficacy of concurrent carboplatin or cetuximab plus radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer patients ineligible for treatment with cisplatin.	BACKGROUND: Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LASCCHN) is usually treated with cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemoradiotherapy, except when patients are elderly or have renal, cardiac, or neurogenic dysfunction. This study compared the safety and efficacy of concurrent carboplatin (CBDCA) to cetuximab (Cmab) plus radiotherapy (RT) in patients ineligible for CDDP treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed LASCCHN patients who received CBDCA plus RT (n = 29) or Cmab plus RT (n = 18) due to ineligibility for CDDP treatment at two Japanese institutions between August 2006 and December 2015. RESULTS: Patients characteristics for CBDCA plus RT and Cmab plus RT were: median age, 74 and 75 years; 0-1 performance status, 90% and 100%; main primary tumor site, hypopharynx 52% (n = 15) and oropharynx 39% (n = 7); and stage IV, 90% (n = 26) and 50% (n = 9), respectively. With a median follow-up time of 60.0 months for CBDCA plus RT and 53.6 months for Cmab plus RT, 3-year locoregional control rates were 56% versus 58%, and median progression-free survival was 42.7 versus 11.6 months. CBDCA plus RT was associated with more grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, whereas Cmab plus RT was associated with more grade 3/4 oral mucositis and radiation dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA or Cmab as a concurrent systemic therapy with RT is a possible treatment option for LASCCHN patients ineligible for CDDP treatment, although attention to hematological toxicity should be paid.

RESULTS: Patients characteristics for CBDCA plus RT and Cmab plus RT were: median age, 74 and 75 years; 0-1 performance status, 90% and 100%; main primary tumor site, hypopharynx 52% (n = 15) and oropharynx 39% (n = 7); and stage IV, 90% (n = 26) and 50% (n = 9), respectively. With a median follow-up time of 60.0 months for CBDCA plus RT and 53.6 months for Cmab plus RT, 3-year locoregional control rates were 56% versus 58%, and median progression-free survival was 42.7 versus 11.6 months. CBDCA plus RT was associated with more grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, whereas Cmab plus RT was associated with more grade 3/4 oral mucositis and radiation dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA or Cmab as a concurrent systemic therapy with RT is a possible treatment option for LASCCHN patients ineligible for CDDP treatment, although attention to hematological toxicity should be paid.
29900768	Isoflurane	Hyperkalemia	1	0	0	1		HYPERKALEMIA IN TWO JAGUARS ( PANTHERA ONCA) ANESTHETIZED WITH DEXMEDETOMIDINE, KETAMINE, AND ISOFLURANE.	  Two jaguars were anesthetized with dexmedetomidine, ketamine, and isoflurane. Arterial blood samples analyzed shortly after darting revealed no abnormalities. Samples analyzed 2 and 1.5 hr after darting revealed moderate hyperkalemia in both animals (6.8 and 6.2 mEq/L, respectively). Shortly after hyperkalemia was recognized, one jaguar developed electrocardiographic abnormalities (sinoventricular rhythm and widened QRS complexes), and a few minutes later, suffered cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitation with chest compressions, intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, and epinephrine was successful, and autonomous breathing and circulation resumed within a few minutes. Anesthesia-related hyperkalemia has been reported in a variety of large felids but has not been reported previously in jaguars. In all reports, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists were used as part of the immobilization protocol. Due to the presumptively high incidence and mortality caused by this complication, frequent monitoring of electrolyte concentrations and prompt treatment of hyperkalemia is recommended when anesthetizing large felids, including jaguars.

29618162	Warfarin	Hemorrhage	0	1	0	0		Renal Impairment, Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism and Bleeding in Cancer Patients with Acute Venous Thromboembolism-Analysis of the CATCH Study.	OBJECTIVE: This article assesses the impact of renal impairment (RI) on the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis from the Comparison of Acute Treatments in Cancer Hemostasis (CATCH) study (NCT01130025). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Renal function was assessed using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis who received either tinzaparin (175 IU/kg) once daily or warfarin for 6 months, in an open-label, randomized, multi-centre trial with blinded adjudication of outcomes. Associations between baseline RI (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] <60 mL/min/1.73m(2)) and recurrent symptomatic or incidental venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinically relevant bleeding (CRB), major bleeding and death were assessed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Baseline-centralized GFR data were available for 864 patients (96% of study population). RI was found in 131 patients (15%; n = 69 tinzaparin). Recurrent VTE occurred in 14% of patients with and 8% of patients without RI (relative risk [RR] 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06, 2.85), CRB in 19% and 14%, respectively (RR 1.33; 95% CI 0.90, 1.98), major bleeding in 6.1% and 2.0%, respectively (RR 2.98; 95% CI 1.29, 6.90) and mortality rate was 40% and 34%, respectively (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.94, 1.53). Patients with RI on tinzaparin showed no difference in recurrent VTE, CRB, major bleeding or mortality rates versus those on warfarin. CONCLUSION: RI in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis on anticoagulation was associated with a statistically significant increase in recurrent VTE and major bleeding, but no significant increase in CRB or mortality. No differences were observed between long-term tinzaparin therapy and warfarin.
29915123	Aspirin	Hemorrhage	0	0	0	0		Efficacy and Safety of Ticagrelor in Relation to Aspirin Use Within the Week Before Randomization in the SOCRATES Trial.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: SOCRATES (Acute Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack Treated With Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes), comparing ticagrelor with aspirin in patients with acute cerebral ischemia, found a nonsignificant 11% relative risk reduction for stroke, myocardial infarction, or death (P=0.07). Aspirin intake before randomization could enhance the effect of ticagrelor by conferring dual antiplatelet effect during a high-risk period for subsequent stroke. Therefore, we explored the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor versus aspirin in the patients who received any aspirin the week before randomization. METHODS: A prespecified subgroup analysis in SOCRATES (n=13 199), randomizing patients with acute ischemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of </=5) or transient ischemic attack (ABCD(2) score of >/=4) to 90-day treatment with ticagrelor or aspirin. Patients in the prior-aspirin group had received any aspirin within the week before randomization. Primary end point was time to stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. Safety end point was PLATO (Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) major bleeding. RESULTS: The 4232 patients in the prior-aspirin group were older, had more vascular risk factors, and vascular disease than the other patients. In the prior-aspirin group, the primary end point occurred in 138/2130 (6.5%) of patients on ticagrelor and in 177/2102 (8.3%) on aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.95; P=0.02); in patients with no prior-aspirin usage an event occurred in 304/4459 (6.9%) and 320/4508 (7.1%) on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.12; P=0.59). The treatment-by-prior-aspirin interaction was not statistically significant (P=0.10). In the prior-aspirin group, major bleeding occurred in 0.7% and 0.4% of patients on ticagrelor and aspirin, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-3.65; P=0.28). CONCLUSIONS: In this secondary analysis from SOCRATES, fewer primary end points occurred on ticagrelor treatment than on aspirin in patients receiving aspirin before randomization, but there was no significant treatment-by-prior-aspirin interaction. A new study will investigate the benefit-risk of combining ticagrelor and aspirin in patients with acute cerebral ischemia (URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT03354429).

29890559	Pregabalin	Eosinophilia	1	1	0	0	1.0	Severe eosinophilic colitis caused by neuropathic agents in a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome and functional abdominal pain: case report and review of the literature.	Eosinophilic colitis is a rare clinical condition that belongs to the group of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Its occurrence can be primary or secondary to infection, medications, or autoimmune/hematological conditions. We present a case of a young female adult with severe chronic fatigue syndrome, widespread chronic pain, including functional abdominal pain, who developed severe eosinophilic colitis following successive treatments with gabapentin and pregabalin. On both occasions, symptoms manifested as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and eosinophilia and improved upon discontinuation of the medications. Magnetic resonance imaging of the small bowel demonstrated an ascending colon colitis, and endoscopic investigations confirmed florid colitis mainly in the ascending colon with biopsies demonstrating a dense eosinophilic infiltrate with micro-abscesses. Serum eosinophil counts correlated well with the timing of the agents' administration. There was no other organ involvement. Symptoms improved upon discontinuation of the drugs and steroid administration. Eosinophilic colitis is an exceptionally rare entity and its mechanism of action is still unclear. Suspicion of eosinophilic colitis should be raised if a patient presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and peripheral eosinophilia following treatment with pregabalin or gabapentin.
